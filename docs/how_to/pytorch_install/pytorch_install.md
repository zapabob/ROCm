# PyTorch Installation for ROCm

## PyTorch

PyTorch is an open source Machine Learning Python library, primarily
differentiated by Tensor computing with GPU acceleration and a type-based
automatic differentiation. Other advanced features include:

- Support for distributed training
- Native ONNX support
- C++ front-end
- The ability to deploy at scale using TorchServe
- A production-ready deployment mechanism through TorchScript

### Installing PyTorch

To install ROCm on bare metal, refer to the sections
[GPU and OS Support (Linux)](../../release/gpu_os_support.md) and
[Compatibility](../../release/compatibility.md) for hardware, software and
3rd-party framework compatibility between ROCm and PyTorch. The recommended
option to get a PyTorch environment is through Docker. However, installing the
PyTorch wheels package on bare metal is also supported.

#### Option 1 (Recommended): Use Docker Image with PyTorch Pre-Installed

Using Docker gives you portability and access to a prebuilt Docker container
that has been rigorously tested within AMD. This might also save on the
compilation time and should perform as it did when tested without facing
potential installation issues.

Follow these steps:

1. Pull the latest public PyTorch Docker image.

   ```bash
   docker pull rocm/pytorch:latest
   ```

   Optionally, you may download a specific and supported configuration with
   different user-space ROCm versions, PyTorch versions, and supported operating
   systems. To download the PyTorch Docker image, refer to
   [https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/pytorch](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/pytorch).

2. Start a Docker container using the downloaded image.

   ```bash
   docker run -it --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --group-add video --ipc=host --shm-size 8G rocm/pytorch:latest
   ```

   :::{note}
   This will automatically download the image if it does not exist on the host.
   You can also pass the -v argument to mount any data directories from the host
   onto the container.

#### Option 2: Install PyTorch Using Wheels Package

PyTorch supports the ROCm platform by providing tested wheels packages. To
access this feature, refer to
[https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
and choose the "ROCm" compute platform. {numref}`Installation-Matrix-from-Pytorch` is a matrix from <https://pytorch.org/> that illustrates the installation compatibility between ROCm and the PyTorch build.

```

To install PyTorch using the wheels package, follow these installation steps:

1. Choose one of the following options:
   a. Obtain a base Docker image with the correct user-space ROCm version
      installed from
      [https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rocm/dev-ubuntu-20.04](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rocm/dev-ubuntu-20.04).

   or

   b. Download a base OS Docker image and install ROCm following the
      installation directions in the section
      [Installation](../../deploy/linux/install.md). ROCm 5.2 is installed in
      this example, as supported by the installation matrix from
      <https://pytorch.org/>.

   or

   c. Install on bare metal. Skip to Step 3.

      ```bash
      docker run -it --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --group-add video rocm/dev-ubuntu-20.04:latest
      ```

2. Start the Docker container, if not installing on bare metal.

   ```dockerfile
   docker run -it --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --group-add video rocm/dev-ubuntu-20.04:latest
   ```

3. Install any dependencies needed for installing the wheels package.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install libjpeg-dev python3-dev
   pip3 install wheel setuptools
   ```

4. Install torch, `torchvision`, and `torchaudio` as specified by the installation
   matrix.

   :::{note}
   ROCm 5.2 PyTorch wheel in the command below is shown for reference.
   :::

   ```bash
   pip3 install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm5.2/
   ```

#### Option 3: Install PyTorch Using PyTorch ROCm Base Docker Image

A prebuilt base Docker image is used to build PyTorch in this option. The base
Docker has all dependencies installed, including:

- ROCm
- Torchvision
- Conda packages
- Compiler toolchain

Additionally, a particular environment flag (`BUILD_ENVIRONMENT`) is set, and
the build scripts utilize that to determine the build environment configuration.

Follow these steps:

1. Obtain the Docker image.

   ```bash
   docker pull rocm/pytorch:latest-base
   ```

   The above will download the base container, which does not contain PyTorch.

2. Start a Docker container using the image.

   ```bash
   docker run -it --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --group-add video --ipc=host --shm-size 8G rocm/pytorch:latest-base
   ```

   You can also pass the -v argument to mount any data directories from the host
   onto the container.

3. Clone the PyTorch repository.

   ```bash
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch.git
   cd pytorch
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

4. Build PyTorch for ROCm.

   :::{note}
   By default in the `rocm/pytorch:latest-base`, PyTorch builds for these
   architectures simultaneously:
   - gfx900
   - gfx906
   - gfx908
   - gfx90a
   - gfx1030
   :::

5. To determine your AMD uarch, run:

   ```bash
   rocminfo | grep gfx
   ```

6. In the event you want to compile only for your uarch, use:

   ```bash
   export PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH=<uarch>
   ```

   `<uarch>` is the architecture reported by the `rocminfo` command.

7. Build PyTorch using the following command:

   ```bash
   ./.jenkins/pytorch/build.sh
   ```

   This will first convert PyTorch sources for HIP compatibility and build the
   PyTorch framework.

8. Alternatively, build PyTorch by issuing the following commands:

   ```bash
   python3 tools/amd_build/build_amd.py
   USE_ROCM=1 MAX_JOBS=4 python3 setup.py install --user
   ```

#### Option 4: Install Using PyTorch Upstream Docker File

Instead of using a prebuilt base Docker image, you can build a custom base
Docker image using scripts from the PyTorch repository. This will utilize a
standard Docker image from operating system maintainers and install all the
dependencies required to build PyTorch, including

- ROCm
- Torchvision
- Conda packages
- Compiler toolchain

Follow these steps:

1. Clone the PyTorch repository on the host.

   ```bash
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch.git
   cd pytorch
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. Build the PyTorch Docker image.

   ```bash
   cd.circleci/docker
   ./build.sh pytorch-linux-bionic-rocm<version>-py3.7
   # eg. ./build.sh pytorch-linux-bionic-rocm3.10-py3.7
   ```

   This should be complete with a message "Successfully build `<image_id>`."

3. Start a Docker container using the image:

   ```bash
   docker run -it --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt
   seccomp=unconfined --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --group-add
   video --ipc=host --shm-size 8G <image_id>
   ```

   You can also pass -v argument to mount any data directories from the host
   onto the container.

4. Clone the PyTorch repository.

   ```bash
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch.git
   cd pytorch
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

5. Build PyTorch for ROCm.

   :::{note}
   By default in the `rocm/pytorch:latest-base`, PyTorch builds for these
   architectures simultaneously:
   - gfx900
   - gfx906
   - gfx908
   - gfx90a
   - gfx1030
   :::

6. To determine your AMD uarch, run:

   ```bash
   rocminfo | grep gfx
   ```

7. If you want to compile only for your uarch:

   ```bash
   export PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH=<uarch>
   ```

   `<uarch>` is the architecture reported by the `rocminfo` command.

8. Build PyTorch using:

   ```bash
   ./.jenkins/pytorch/build.sh
   ```

This will first convert PyTorch sources to be HIP compatible and then build the
PyTorch framework.

Alternatively, build PyTorch by issuing the following commands:

```bash
python3 tools/amd_build/build_amd.py
USE_ROCM=1 MAX_JOBS=4 python3 setup.py install --user
```

### Test the PyTorch Installation

You can use PyTorch unit tests to validate a PyTorch installation. If using a
prebuilt PyTorch Docker image from AMD ROCm DockerHub or installing an official
wheels package, these tests are already run on those configurations.
Alternatively, you can manually run the unit tests to validate the PyTorch
installation fully.

Follow these steps:

1. Test if PyTorch is installed and accessible by importing the torch package in
   Python.

   :::{note}
   Do not run in the PyTorch git folder.
   :::

   ```bash
   python3 -c 'import torch' 2> /dev/null && echo 'Success' || echo 'Failure'
   ```

2. Test if the GPU is accessible from PyTorch. In the PyTorch framework,
   `torch.cuda` is a generic mechanism to access the GPU; it will access an AMD
   GPU only if available.

   ```bash
   python3 -c 'import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())'
   ```

3. Run the unit tests to validate the PyTorch installation fully. Run the
   following command from the PyTorch home directory:

   ```bash
   BUILD_ENVIRONMENT=${BUILD_ENVIRONMENT:-rocm} ./.jenkins/pytorch/test.sh
   ```

   This ensures that even for wheel installs in a non-controlled environment,
   the required environment variable will be set to skip certain unit tests for
   ROCm.

   :::{note}
   Make sure the PyTorch source code is corresponding to the PyTorch wheel or
   installation in the Docker image. Incompatible PyTorch source code might give
   errors when running the unit tests.
   :::

   This will first install some dependencies, such as a supported `torchvision`
   version for PyTorch. `torchvision` is used in some PyTorch tests for loading
   models. Next, this will run all the unit tests.

   :::{note}
   Some tests may be skipped, as appropriate, based on your system
   configuration. All features of PyTorch are not supported on ROCm, and the
   tests that evaluate these features are skipped. In addition, depending on the
   host memory, or the number of available GPUs, other tests may be skipped. No
   test should fail if the compilation and installation are correct.
   :::

4. Run individual unit tests with the following command:

   ```bash
   PYTORCH_TEST_WITH_ROCM=1 python3 test/test_nn.py --verbose
   ```

   `test_nn.py` can be replaced with any other test set.

### Run a Basic PyTorch Example

The PyTorch examples repository provides basic examples that exercise the
functionality of the framework. MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards
and Technology) database is a collection of handwritten digits that may be used
to train a Convolutional Neural Network for handwriting recognition.
Alternatively, ImageNet is a database of images used to train a network for
visual object recognition.

Follow these steps:

1. Clone the PyTorch examples repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pytorch/examples.git
   ```

2. Run the MNIST example.

   ```bash
   cd examples/mnist
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the `README` file in this folder. In this case:

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   python3 main.py
   ```

4. Run the ImageNet example.

   ```bash
   cd examples/imagenet
   ```

5. Follow the instructions in the `README` file in this folder. In this case:

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   python3 main.py
   ```
