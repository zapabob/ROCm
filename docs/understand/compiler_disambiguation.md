| AOCC | Closed-source clang-based compiler that includes additional CPU optimizations. Offered as part of ROCm via the `rocm-llvm-alt` package. See for details, <a href="https://developer.amd.com/amd-aocc/" target="_blank">https://developer.amd.com/amd-aocc/</a>. |
| HIP-Clang | Informal term for the `amdclang++` compiler |

| `hipcc` | HIP compiler driver. A utility that invokes `clang` or `nvcc` depending on the target and passes the appropriate include and library options for the target compiler and HIP infrastructure. The source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIPCC" target="_blank">https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIPCC</a>. |
| ROCmCC | Clang/LLVM-based compiler. ROCmCC in itself is not a binary but refers to the overall compiler. |
