# What is ROCm?

ROCm is an open-source stack for GPU computation. ROCm is primarily Open-Source
Software (OSS) that allows developers the freedom to customize and tailor their
GPU software for their own needs while collaborating with a community of other
developers, and helping each other find solutions in an agile, flexible, rapid
and secure manner.

ROCm is a collection of drivers, development tools and APIs enabling GPU
programming from the low-level kernel to end-user applications. ROCm is powered
by AMD’s Heterogeneous-computing Interface for Portability (HIP), an OSS C++ GPU
programming environment and its corresponding runtime. HIP allows ROCm
developers to create portable applications on different platforms by deploying
code on a range of platforms, from dedicated gaming GPUs to exascale HPC
clusters. ROCm supports programming models such as OpenMP and OpenCL, and
includes all the necessary OSS compilers, debuggers and libraries. ROCm is fully
integrated into ML frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. ROCm can be
deployed in many ways, including through the use of containers such as Docker,
Spack, and your own build from source.

ROCm’s goal is to allow our users to maximize their GPU hardware investment.
ROCm is designed to help develop, test and deploy GPU accelerated HPC, AI,
scientific computing, CAD, and other applications in a free, open-source,
integrated and secure software ecosystem.
