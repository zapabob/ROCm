# Contributing to ROCm documentation

AMD values and encourages contributions to our code and documentation. If you choose to
contribute, we encourage you to be polite and respectful. Improving documentation is a long-term
process, to which we are dedicated.

If you have issues when trying to contribute, refer to the
[discussions](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm/discussions) page in our GitHub
repository.

## Folder structure and naming convention

Our documentation follows the Pitchfork folder structure. Most documentation files are stored in the
`/docs` folder. Some special files (such as release, contributing, and changelog) are stored in the root
(`/`) folder.

All images are stored in the `/docs/data` folder. An image's file path mirrors that of the documentation
file where it is used.

Our naming structure uses kebab case; for example, `my-file-name.rst`.

## Supported formats and syntax

Our documentation includes both Markdown and RST files. We are gradually transitioning existing
Markdown to RST in order to more effectively meet our documentation needs. When contributing,
RST is preferred; if you must use Markdown, use GitHub-flavored Markdown.

We use [Sphinx Design](https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) syntax and compile
our API references using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/).

The following table shows some common documentation components and the syntax convention we
use for each:

## Language and style

We use the
[Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights) to
guide our content.

Font size and type, page layout, white space control, and other formatting
details are controlled via
[rocm-docs-core](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/rocm-docs-core). If you want to notify us
of any formatting issues, create a pull request in our
[rocm-docs-core](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/rocm-docs-core) GitHub repository.
