### What's New in This Release

### ROCm Libraries

#### rocBLAS
A new functionality rocblas-gemm-tune and an environment variable ROCBLAS_TENSILE_GEMM_OVERRIDE_PATH are added to rocBLAS in the ROCm 5.7.1 release.

*rocblas-gemm-tune* is used to find the best-performing GEMM kernel for each GEMM problem set. It has a command line interface, which mimics the --yaml input used by rocblas-bench. To generate the expected --yaml input, profile logging can be used, by setting the environment variable ROCBLAS_LAYER4.

For more information on rocBLAS logging, see Logging in rocBLAS, in the [API Reference Guide](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocBLAS/en/docs-5.7.1/API_Reference_Guide.html#logging-in-rocblas).

An example input file: Expected output (note selected GEMM idx may differ): Where the far right values (solution_index) are the indices of the best-performing kernels for those GEMMs in the rocBLAS kernel library. These indices can be directly used in future GEMM calls. See rocBLAS/samples/example_user_driven_tuning.cpp for sample code of directly using kernels via their indices.

If the output is stored in a file, the results can be used to override default kernel selection with the kernels found, by setting the environment variable ROCBLAS_TENSILE_GEMM_OVERRIDE_PATH, where points to the stored file.

For more details, refer to the [rocBLAS Programmer's Guide.](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocBLAS/en/latest/Programmers_Guide.html#rocblas-gemm-tune)

#### HIP 5.7.1 (for ROCm 5.7.1)

ROCm 5.7.1 is a point release with several bug fixes in the HIP runtime.

### Fixed defects
The *hipPointerGetAttributes* API returns the correct HIP memory type as *hipMemoryTypeManaged* for managed memory.
