  before including `float.h`, `math.h`, and `rocblas.h`)
* The default build removes device code for gfx803 architecture from the fat binary

##### Fixes

  `GTEST_LISTENER=PASS_LINE_IN_LOG` environment variable)

#### rocFFT 1.0.25

rocFFT 1.0.25 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Additions

* Implemented experimental APIs to allow computing FFTs on data distributed across multiple devices
  in a single process

  * `rocfft_field` is a new type that can be added to a plan description to describe the layout of FFT
    input or output
  * `rocfft_field_add_brick` can be called to describe the brick decomposition of an FFT field, where each
    brick can be assigned a different device

  These interfaces are still experimental and subject to change. We are interested in getting feedback.
  You can raise questions and concerns by opening issues in the
  [rocFFT issue tracker](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocFFT/issues).

  Note that multi-device FFTs currently have several limitations (we plan to address these in future
  releases):

  * Real-complex (forward or inverse) FFTs are not supported
  * Planar format fields are not supported
  * Batch (the `number_of_transforms` provided to `rocfft_plan_create`) must be 1
  * FFT input is gathered to the current device at run time, so all FFT data must fit on that device

##### Optimizations

* Improved the performance of several 2D/3D real FFTs supported by `2D_SINGLE` kernel. Offline
  tuning provides more optimization for fx90a
* Removed an extra kernel launch from even-length, real-complex FFTs that use callbacks

##### Changes

* Built kernels in a solution map to the library kernel cache
* Real forward transforms (real-to-complex) no longer overwrite input; rocFFT may still overwrite real
  inverse (complex-to-real) input, as this allows for faster performance

* `rocfft-rider` and `dyna-rocfft-rider` have been renamed to `rocfft-bench` and `dyna-rocfft-bench`;
  these are controlled by the `BUILD_CLIENTS_BENCH` CMake option
  * Links for the former file names are installed, and the former `BUILD_CLIENTS_RIDER` CMake option
    is accepted for compatibility, but both will be removed in a future release
* Binaries in debug builds no longer have a `-d` suffix

##### Fixes

* rocFFT now correctly handles load callbacks that convert data from a smaller data type (e.g., 16-bit
  integers -> 32-bit float)

#### rocm-cmake 0.11.0

rocm-cmake 0.11.0 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Changes

* Improved validation, documentation, and rocm-docs-core integration for ROCMSphinxDoc

##### Fixes

* Fixed extra `make` flags passed for Clang-Tidy (ROCMClangTidy).
* Fixed issues with ROCMTest when using a module in a subdirectory

#### rocPRIM 3.0.0

rocPRIM 3.0.0 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Additions

* `block_sort::sort()` overload for keys and values with a dynamic size, for all block sort algorithms
* All `block_sort::sort()` overloads with a dynamic size are now supported for
  `block_sort_algorithm::merge_sort` and `block_sort_algorithm::bitonic_sort`
*  New two-way partition primitive `partition_two_way`, which can write to two separate iterators

##### Optimizations

* Improved `partition` performance

##### Fixes

* Fixed `rocprim::MatchAny` for devices with 64-bit warp size
  * Note that `rocprim::MatchAny` is deprecated; use `rocprim::match_any` instead

#### rocRAND 2.10.17

rocRAND 2.10.17 for ROCm 6.0.0

### Changes

* Generator classes from `rocrand.hpp` are no longer copyable (in previous versions these copies
  would copy internal references to the generators and would lead to double free or memory leak
  errors)
  * These types should be moved instead of copied; move constructors and operators are now
    defined

### Optimizations

* Improved MT19937 initialization and generation performance

### Removals

* Removed the hipRAND submodule from rocRAND; hipRAND is now only available as a separate
  package
* Removed references to, and workarounds for, the deprecated hcc

### Fixes

* `mt19937_engine` from `rocrand.hpp` is now move-constructible and move-assignable (the move
  constructor and move assignment operator was deleted for this class)
* Various fixes for the C++ wrapper header `rocrand.hpp`
  * The name of `mrg31k3p` it is now correctly spelled (was incorrectly named `mrg31k3a` in previous
    versions)
  * Added the missing `order` setter method for `threefry4x64`
  * Fixed the default ordering parameter for `lfsr113`
* Build error when using Clang++ directly resulting from unsupported `amdgpu-target` references

#### rocSOLVER 3.24.0

rocSOLVER 3.24.0 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Additions

* Added `rocsolver_rfinfo_mode` and the ability to specify the desired refactorization routine (see `rocsolver_set_rfinfo_mode`)

##### Changes

* `CSRRF_ANALYSIS` and `CSRRF_SOLVE` now support sparse Cholesky factorization

#### rocSPARSE 3.0.2

rocSPARSE 3.0.2 for ROCm 6.0.0

* When using host pointer mode, you must now call `hipStreamSynchronize` following `doti`, `dotci`,
  `spvv`, and `csr2ell`
* Improved documentation
* Improved verbose output during argument checking on API function calls

##### Removals

* Auto stages from `spmv`, `spmm`, `spgemm`, `spsv`, `spsm`, and `spitsv`
* Formerly deprecated `rocsparse_spmm_ex` routine

### Fixes

* Bug in `rocsparse-bench` where the SpMV algorithm was not taken into account in CSR format
* BSR and GEBSR routines (`bsrmv`, `bsrsv`, `bsrmm`, `bsrgeam`, `gebsrmv`, `gebsrmm`) didn't always
  show `block_dim==0` as an invalid size
* Passing `nnz = 0` to `doti` or `dotci` wasn't always returning a dot product of 0

### Additions

* `rocsparse_inverse_permutation`
* Mixed-precisions for SpVV
* Uniform int8 precision for gather and scatter

#### rocThrust 3.0.0

rocThrust 3.0.0 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Additions

* Updated to match upstream Thrust 2.0.1
* `NV_IF_TARGET` macro from libcu++ for NVIDIA backend and HIP implementation for HIP backend

##### Changes

* The CMake build system now accepts `GPU_TARGETS` in addition to `AMDGPU_TARGETS` for
  setting targeted GPU architectures
  * `GPU_TARGETS=all` compiles for all supported architectures
  * `AMDGPU_TARGETS` is only provided for backwards compatibility (`GPU_TARGETS` is preferred)
* Removed CUB symlink from the root of the repository
* Removed support for deprecated macros (`THRUST_DEVICE_BACKEND` and
  `THRUST_HOST_BACKEND`)

##### Known issues

* The `THRUST_HAS_CUDART` macro, which is no longer used in Thrust (it's provided only for legacy
  support) is replaced with `NV_IF_TARGET` and `THRUST_RDC_ENABLED` in the NVIDIA backend. The
  HIP backend doesn't have a `THRUST_RDC_ENABLED` macro, so some branches in Thrust code may
  be unreachable in the HIP backend.

#### AMD Instinct™ MI50 end-of-support notice

AMD Instinct MI50, Radeon Pro VII, and Radeon VII products (collectively gfx906 GPUs) will enter
maintenance mode starting Q3 2023.

As outlined in [5.6.0](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-5.6.0/release.html), ROCm 5.7 will be the
final release for gfx906 GPUs to be in a fully supported state.

* ROCm 6.0 shows MI50s as "under maintenance" for
  [Linux](../about/compatibility/linux-support.md) and
  [Windows](../about/compatibility/windows-support.md)

* No new features and performance optimizations will be supported for the gfx906 GPUs beyond
  ROCm 5.7.

* Bug fixes and critical security patches will continue to be supported for the gfx906 GPUs until Q2
  2024 (end of maintenance \[EOM] will be aligned with the closest ROCm release).

* Bug fixes during the maintenance will be made to the next ROCm point release.

* Bug fixes will not be backported to older ROCm releases for gfx906.

* Distribution and operating system updates will continue per the ROCm release cadence for gfx906
  GPUs until EOM.
