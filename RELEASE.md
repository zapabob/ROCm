The release notes for the ROCm platform.

-------------------

## ROCm 5.7.0
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable no-duplicate-header -->

### What's new in this release

ROCm 5.7.0 includes many new features. These include: a new library (hipTensor), and optimizations for rocRAND and MIVisionX. Address sanitizer for host and device code (GPU) is now available as a beta. Note that ROCm 5.7.0 is EOS for MI50. 5.7 versions of ROCm are the last major release in the ROCm 5 series. This release is Linux-only.

Important: The next major ROCm release (ROCm 6.0) will not be backward compatible with the ROCm 5 series. Changes will include: splitting LLVM packages into more manageable sizes, changes to the HIP runtime API, splitting rocRAND and hipRAND into separate packages, and reorganizing our file structure.

### Fixed defects

* *hipMemcpy* device-to-device (inter-device) is now asynchronous with respect to the host
* Enabled xnack+ check in HIP catch2 tests hang when executing tests
* Memory leak when code object files are loaded/unloaded via hipModuleLoad/hipModuleUnload APIs
* Using *hipGraphAddMemFreeNode* no longer results in a crash
