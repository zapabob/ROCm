ROCm 6.0 is a major release with new performance optimizations, expanded frameworks and library
support, and improved developer experience. This includes initial enablement of the AMD Instinct™
MI300 series. Future releases will further enable and optimize this new platform. Key features include:

* Improved performance in areas like lower precision math and attention layers.
* New hipSPARSELt library to accelerate AI workloads via AMD's sparse matrix core technique.
* Latest upstream support for popular AI frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX.
* New support for libraries, such as DeepSpeed, ONNX-RT, and CuPy.
* Prepackaged HPC and AI containers on AMD Infinity Hub, with improved documentation and
  tutorials on the [AMD ROCm Docs](https://rocm.docs.amd.com) site.
* Consolidated developer resources and training on the new AMD ROCm Developer Hub.

The following section provide a release overview for ROCm 6.0. For additional details, you can refer to
the [Changelog](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/develop/about/CHANGELOG.html).

### OS and GPU support changes

AMD Instinct™ MI300A and MI300X Accelerator support has been enabled for limited operating
systems.

* Ubuntu 22.04.5 (MI300A and MI300X)
* RHEL 8.9 (MI300A)
* SLES 15 SP5

We've added support for the following operating systems:

* RHEL 9.3
* RHEL 8.9

Note that, of ROCm 6.2, we've planned for end-of-support (EoS) for the following operating systems:

* Ubuntu 20.04.5
* SLES 15 SP4
* RHEL/CentOS 7.9

### New ROCm meta package

We've added a new ROCm meta package for easy installation of all ROCm core packages, tools, and
libraries. For example, the following command will install the full ROCm package: `apt-get install rocm`
(Ubuntu), or `yum install rocm` (RHEL).

### Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

ROCm 6.0 fully adopts the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) reorganization goals. We've removed
the backward compatibility support for old file locations.

### Compiler location change

* The installation path of LLVM has been changed from `/opt/rocm-<rel>/llvm` to
  `/opt/rocm-<rel>/lib/llvm`. For backward compatibility, a symbolic link is provided to the old
  location and will be removed in a future release.
* The installation path of the device library bitcode has changed from `/opt/rocm-<rel>/amdgcn` to
  `/opt/rocm-<rel>/lib/llvm/lib/clang/<ver>/lib/amdgcn`. For backward compatibility, a symbolic link
  is provided and will be removed in a future release.

### Documentation

CMake support has been added for documentation in the
[ROCm repository](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm).

### AMD Instinct™ MI50 end-of-support notice

AMD Instinct MI50, Radeon Pro VII, and Radeon VII products (collectively gfx906 GPUs) enters
maintenance mode in ROCm 6.0.

As outlined in [5.6.0](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-5.6.0/release.html), ROCm 5.7 was the
final release for gfx906 GPUs in a fully supported state.

  * Henceforth, no new features and performance optimizations will be supported for the gfx906 GPUs.
  * Bug fixes and critical security patches will continue to be supported for the gfx906 GPUs until Q2
    2024 (end of maintenance \[EOM] will be aligned with the closest ROCm release).
  * Bug fixes will be made up to the next ROCm point release.
  * Bug fixes will not be backported to older ROCm releases for gfx906.
  * Distribution and operating system updates will continue per the ROCm release cadence for gfx906
    GPUs until EOM.

### Known issues

* Hang is observed with rocSPARSE tests: [Issue 2726](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/2726).
* AddressSanitizer instrumentation is incorrect for device global variables:
  [Issue 2551](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/2551).
* Dynamically loaded HIP runtime library references incorrect version of `hipDeviceGetProperties`
  API: [Issue 2728](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/2728).
* Memory access violations when running rocFFT-HMM:
  [Issue 2730](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/2730).

#### AMDMIGraphX 2.8

MIGraphX 2.8 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Additions

* Support for TorchMIGraphX via PyTorch
* Boosted overall performance by integrating rocMLIR

  Metrics include power, energy, performance, and other system details.

* Added support for gfx942 metrics: You can now query MI300 device metrics to get real-time
  information. Metrics include power, temperature, energy, and performance.

* Added support for compute and memory partitions

#### HIP 6.0.0

HIP 6.0.0 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Additions

* New fields and structs for external resource interoperability
  * `hipExternalMemoryHandleDesc_st`
  * `hipExternalMemoryBufferDesc_st`
  * `hipExternalSemaphoreHandleDesc_st`
  * `hipExternalSemaphoreSignalParams_st`
  * `hipExternalSemaphoreWaitParams_st Enumerations`
  * `hipExternalMemoryHandleType_enum`
  * `hipExternalSemaphoreHandleType_enum`
  * `hipExternalMemoryHandleType_enum`

* New environment variable `HIP_LAUNCH_BLOCKING`
  * For serialization on kernel execution. The default value is 0 (disable); kernel will execute normally as
        defined in the queue. When this environment variable is set as 1 (enable), HIP runtime will
        serialize kernel enqueue; behaves the same as AMD_SERIALIZE_KERNEL.

* More members are added in HIP struct `hipDeviceProp_t`, for new feature capabilities including:
  * Texture
      * `int maxTexture1DMipmap;`
      * `int maxTexture2DMipmap[2];`
      * `int maxTexture2DLinear[3];`
      * `int maxTexture2DGather[2];`
      * `int maxTexture3DAlt[3];`
      * `int maxTextureCubemap;`
      * `int maxTexture1DLayered[2];`
      * `int maxTexture2DLayered[3];`
      * `int maxTextureCubemapLayered[2];`
  * Surface
      * `int maxSurface1D;`
      * `int maxSurface2D[2];`
      * `int maxSurface3D[3];`
      * `int maxSurface1DLayered[2];`
      * `int maxSurface2DLayered[3];`
      * `int maxSurfaceCubemap;`
      * `int maxSurfaceCubemapLayered[2];`
  * Device
      * `hipUUID uuid;`
      * `char luid[8];` this is an 8-byte unique identifier. Only valid on Windows
      * `unsigned int luidDeviceNodeMask;`

* LUID (Locally Unique Identifier) is supported for interoperability between devices. In HIP, more
        members are added in the struct `hipDeviceProp_t`, as properties to identify each device:
    * `char luid[8];`
    * `unsigned int luidDeviceNodeMask;`

Note: HIP supports LUID only on Windows OS.

##### Changes

* Some OpenGL Interop HIP APIs are moved from the hip_runtime_api header to a new header file hip_gl_interop.h for the AMD platform, as follows:
  * `hipGLGetDevices`
  * `hipGraphicsGLRegisterBuffer`
  * `hipGraphicsGLRegisterImage`

###### Changes impacting backward incompatibility

* Data types for members in `HIP_MEMCPY3D` structure are changed from `unsigned int` to `size_t`.
* The value of the flag `hipIpcMemLazyEnablePeerAccess` is changed to `0x01`, which was previously
  defined as `0`
* Some device property attributes are not currently supported in HIP runtime. In order to maintain
   consistency, the following related enumeration names are changed in `hipDeviceAttribute_t`
  * `hipDeviceAttributeName` is changed to `hipDeviceAttributeUnused1`
  * `hipDeviceAttributeUuid` is changed to `hipDeviceAttributeUnused2`
  * `hipDeviceAttributeArch` is changed to `hipDeviceAttributeUnused3`
  * `hipDeviceAttributeGcnArch` is changed to `hipDeviceAttributeUnused4`
  * `hipDeviceAttributeGcnArchName` is changed to `hipDeviceAttributeUnused5`
* HIP struct `hipArray` is removed from driver type header to comply with CUDA
* `hipArray_t` replaces `hipArray*`, as the pointer to array.
  * This allows `hipMemcpyAtoH` and `hipMemcpyHtoA` to have the correct array type which is
        equivalent to corresponding CUDA driver APIs.

##### Fixes

* Kernel launch maximum dimension validation is added specifically on gridY and gridZ in the HIP API `hipModule-LaunchKernel`. As a result,when `hipGetDeviceAttribute` is called for the value of `hipDeviceAttributeMaxGrid-Dim`, the behavior on the AMD platform is equivalent to NVIDIA.

* The HIP stream synchronization behavior is changed in internal stream functions, in which a flag "wait" is added and set when the current stream is null pointer while executing stream synchronization on other explicitly created streams. This change avoids blocking of execution on null/default stream. The change won't affect usage of applications, and makes them behave the same on the AMD platform as NVIDIA.

* Error handling behavior on unsupported GPU is fixed, HIP runtime will log out error message, instead of creating signal abortion error which is invisible to developers but continued kernel execution process. This is for the case when developers compile any application via hipcc, setting the option `--offload-arch` with GPU ID which is different from the one on the system.

* HIP complex vector type multiplication and division operations. On AMD platform, some duplicated complex operators are removed to avoid compilation failures. In HIP, `hipFloatComplex` and `hipDoubleComplex` are defined as complex data types: `typedef float2 hipFloatComplex; typedef double2 hipDoubleComplex;` Any application that uses complex multiplication and division operations needs to replace '*' and '/' operators with the following:
  * `hipCmulf()` and `hipCdivf()` for `hipFloatComplex`
  * `hipCmul()` and `hipCdiv()` for `hipDoubleComplex`
Note: These complex operations are equivalent to corresponding types/functions on NVIDIA platform.

##### Removals

* Deprecated Heterogeneous Compute (HCC) symbols and flags are removed from the HIP source code, including:
  * Build options on obsolete `HCC_OPTIONS` were removed from cmake.
  * Micro definitions are removed:
    * `HIP_INCLUDE_HIP_HCC_DETAIL_DRIVER_TYPES_H`
    * `HIP_INCLUDE_HIP_HCC_DETAIL_HOST_DEFINES_H`
  * Compilation flags for the platform definitions
    * AMD platform
      * `HIP_PLATFORM_HCC`
      * `HCC`
      * `HIP_ROCclr`
    * NVIDIA platform
      * `HIP_PLATFORM_NVCC`
* File directories in the clr repository are removed, for more details see https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/clr/blob/develop/hipamd/include/hip/hcc_detail and https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/clr/blob/develop/hipamd/include/hip/nvcc_detail
* Deprecated gcnArch is removed from hip device struct `hipDeviceProp_t`.
* Deprecated `enum hipMemoryType memoryType;` is removed from HIP struct `hipPointerAttribute_t` union.

#### rocFFT 1.0.25

rocFFT 1.0.25 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Additions

* Implemented experimental APIs to allow computing FFTs on data distributed across multiple devices
  in a single process

  * `rocfft_field` is a new type that can be added to a plan description to describe the layout of FFT
    input or output
  * `rocfft_field_add_brick` can be called to describe the brick decomposition of an FFT field, where each
    brick can be assigned a different device

  These interfaces are still experimental and subject to change. Your feedback is appreciated.
  You can raise questions and concerns by opening issues in the
  [rocFFT issue tracker](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocFFT/issues).

  Note that multi-device FFTs currently have several limitations (we plan to address these in future
  releases):

  * Real-complex (forward or inverse) FFTs are not supported
  * Planar format fields are not supported
  * Batch (the `number_of_transforms` provided to `rocfft_plan_create`) must be 1
  * FFT input is gathered to the current device at run time, so all FFT data must fit on that device

##### Optimizations

* Improved the performance of several 2D/3D real FFTs supported by `2D_SINGLE` kernel. Offline
  tuning provides more optimization for fx90a
* Removed an extra kernel launch from even-length, real-complex FFTs that use callbacks

##### Changes

* Built kernels in a solution map to the library kernel cache
* Real forward transforms (real-to-complex) no longer overwrite input; rocFFT may still overwrite real
  inverse (complex-to-real) input, as this allows for faster performance

* `rocfft-rider` and `dyna-rocfft-rider` have been renamed to `rocfft-bench` and `dyna-rocfft-bench`;
  these are controlled by the `BUILD_CLIENTS_BENCH` CMake option
  * Links for the former file names are installed, and the former `BUILD_CLIENTS_RIDER` CMake option
    is accepted for compatibility, but both will be removed in a future release
* Binaries in debug builds no longer have a `-d` suffix

##### Fixes

* rocFFT now correctly handles load callbacks that convert data from a smaller data type (e.g., 16-bit
  integers -> 32-bit float)

#### ROCgdb 13.2

ROCgdb 13.2 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Additions

* Support for watchpoints on scratch memory addresses.
* Added support for gfx1100, gfx1101, and gfx1102.
* Added support for gfx942.

##### Optimizations

* Improved performances when handling the end of a process with a large number of threads.

##### Known issues

* On certain configurations, ROCgdb can show the following warning message:
  `warning: Probes-based dynamic linker interface failed. Reverting to original interface.`
  This does not affect ROCgdb's functionalities.

* ROCgdb cannot debug a program on an AMDGPU device past a
  `s_sendmsg sendmsg(MSG_DEALLOC_VGPRS)` instruction. If an exception is reported after this
  instruction has been executed (including asynchronous exceptions), the wave is killed and the
  exceptions are only reported by the ROCm runtime.

#### rocm-cmake 0.11.0

rocm-cmake 0.11.0 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Changes

* Improved validation, documentation, and rocm-docs-core integration for ROCMSphinxDoc

* Fixed issues with ROCMTest when using a module in a subdirectory

#### ROCm Compiler

* On MI300, kernel arguments can be preloaded into SGPRs rather than passed in memory. This
  feature is enabled with a compiler option, which also controls the number of arguments to pass in
   SGPRs.

* Improved register allocation at -O0: Avoid compiler crashes ( 'ran out of registers during register allocation' )

* Improved generation of debug information:
    * Improve compile time
    * Avoid compiler crashes

#### rocPRIM 3.0.0

* All `block_sort::sort()` overloads with a dynamic size are now supported for
  `block_sort_algorithm::merge_sort` and `block_sort_algorithm::bitonic_sort`
*  New two-way partition primitive `partition_two_way`, which can write to two separate iterators

##### Optimizations

* Improved `partition` performance

##### Fixes

* Fixed `rocprim::MatchAny` for devices with 64-bit warp size
  * Note that `rocprim::MatchAny` is deprecated; use `rocprim::match_any` instead

#### rocRAND 2.10.17

rocRAND 2.10.17 for ROCm 6.0.0

### Changes

* Generator classes from `rocrand.hpp` are no longer copyable (in previous versions these copies
  would copy internal references to the generators and would lead to double free or memory leak
  errors)
  * These types should be moved instead of copied; move constructors and operators are now
    defined

### Optimizations

* Improved MT19937 initialization and generation performance

### Removals

* Removed the hipRAND submodule from rocRAND; hipRAND is now only available as a separate
  package
* Removed references to, and workarounds for, the deprecated hcc

### Fixes

* `mt19937_engine` from `rocrand.hpp` is now move-constructible and move-assignable (the move
  constructor and move assignment operator was deleted for this class)
* Various fixes for the C++ wrapper header `rocrand.hpp`
  * The name of `mrg31k3p` it is now correctly spelled (was incorrectly named `mrg31k3a` in previous
    versions)
  * Added the missing `order` setter method for `threefry4x64`
  * Fixed the default ordering parameter for `lfsr113`
* Build error when using Clang++ directly resulting from unsupported `amdgpu-target` references

#### rocSOLVER 3.24.0

rocSOLVER 3.24.0 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Additions

* Cholesky refactorization for sparse matrices: `CSRRF_REFACTCHOL`
* Added `rocsolver_rfinfo_mode` and the ability to specify the desired refactorization routine (see `rocsolver_set_rfinfo_mode`)

##### Changes

* `CSRRF_ANALYSIS` and `CSRRF_SOLVE` now support sparse Cholesky factorization

#### rocSPARSE 3.0.2

rocSPARSE 3.0.2 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Changes

* Function arguments for `rocsparse_spmv`
* Function arguments for `rocsparse_xbsrmv` routines
* When using host pointer mode, you must now call `hipStreamSynchronize` following `doti`, `dotci`,
  `spvv`, and `csr2ell`
* Improved documentation
* Improved verbose output during argument checking on API function calls

##### Removals

* Auto stages from `spmv`, `spmm`, `spgemm`, `spsv`, `spsm`, and `spitsv`
* Formerly deprecated `rocsparse_spmm_ex` routine

### Fixes

* Bug in `rocsparse-bench` where the SpMV algorithm was not taken into account in CSR format
* BSR and GEBSR routines (`bsrmv`, `bsrsv`, `bsrmm`, `bsrgeam`, `gebsrmv`, `gebsrmm`) didn't always
  show `block_dim==0` as an invalid size
* Passing `nnz = 0` to `doti` or `dotci` wasn't always returning a dot product of 0

### Additions

* `rocsparse_inverse_permutation`
* Mixed-precisions for SpVV
* Uniform int8 precision for gather and scatter

#### rocThrust 3.0.0

rocThrust 3.0.0 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Additions

* Updated to match upstream Thrust 2.0.1
* `NV_IF_TARGET` macro from libcu++ for NVIDIA backend and HIP implementation for HIP backend

##### Changes

* The CMake build system now accepts `GPU_TARGETS` in addition to `AMDGPU_TARGETS` for
  setting targeted GPU architectures
  * `GPU_TARGETS=all` compiles for all supported architectures
  * `AMDGPU_TARGETS` is only provided for backwards compatibility (`GPU_TARGETS` is preferred)
* Removed CUB symlink from the root of the repository
* Removed support for deprecated macros (`THRUST_DEVICE_BACKEND` and
  `THRUST_HOST_BACKEND`)

##### Known issues

* The `THRUST_HAS_CUDART` macro, which is no longer used in Thrust (it's provided only for legacy
  support) is replaced with `NV_IF_TARGET` and `THRUST_RDC_ENABLED` in the NVIDIA backend. The
  HIP backend doesn't have a `THRUST_RDC_ENABLED` macro, so some branches in Thrust code may
  be unreachable in the HIP backend.
