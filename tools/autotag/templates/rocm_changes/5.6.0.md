##### OS and GPU Support Changes

- SLES15 SP5 support was added this release. SLES15 SP3 support was dropped.
- AMD Instinct MI50, Radeon Pro VII, and Radeon VII products (collectively referred to as gfx906 GPUs) will be entering the maintenance mode starting Q3 2023. This will be aligned with ROCm 5.7 GA release date.
  - No new features and performance optimizations will be supported for the gfx906 GPUs beyond ROCm 5.7
  - Bug fixes / critical security patches will continue to be supported for the gfx906 GPUs till Q2 2024 (End of Maintenance [EOM])(will be aligned with the closest ROCm release)
  - Bug fixes during the maintenance will be made to the next ROCm point release
  - Bug fixes will not be back ported to older ROCm releases for this SKU
  - Distro / Operating system updates will continue as per the ROCm release cadence for gfx906 GPUs till EOM.

##### HIP 5.6 (For ROCm 5.6)

###### Optimizations

- Consolidation of hipamd, rocclr and OpenCL projects in clr
- Optimized lock for graph global capture mode

###### Added

- Added hipRTC support for amd_hip_fp16
- Added hipStreamGetDevice implementation to get the device associated with the stream
- Added HIP_AD_FORMAT_SIGNED_INT16 in hipArray formats
- hipArrayGetInfo for getting information about the specified array
- hipArrayGetDescriptor for getting 1D or 2D array descriptor
- hipArray3DGetDescriptor to get 3D array descriptor

###### Changed

- hipMallocAsync to return success for zero size allocation to match hipMalloc
- Separation of hipcc perl binaries from HIP project to hipcc project. hip-devel package depends on newly added hipcc package
- Consolidation of hipamd, ROCclr, and OpenCL repositories into a single repository called clr. Instructions are updated to build HIP from sources in the HIP Installation guide
- Removed hipBusBandwidth and hipCommander samples from hip-tests

###### Fixed

- Fixed regression in hipMemCpyParam3D when offset is applied

###### Known Issues

- Limited testing on xnack+ configuration
  - Multiple HIP tests failures (gpuvm fault or hangs)

###### Upcoming changes in future release

- Removal of gcnarch from hipDeviceProp_t structure
- Addition of new fields in hipDeviceProp_t structure
  - maxTexture1D
  - maxTexture2D
  - maxTexture1DLayered
  - maxTexture2DLayered
  - sharedMemPerMultiprocessor
  - deviceOverlap
  - asyncEngineCount
  - surfaceAlignment
  - unifiedAddressing
  - computePreemptionSupported
  - uuid
- Removal of deprecated code
  - hip-hcc codes from hip code tree
- Correct hipArray usage in HIP APIs such as hipMemcpyAtoH and hipMemcpyHtoA
- HIPMEMCPY_3D fields correction (unsigned int -> size_t)
- Renaming of 'memoryType' in hipPointerAttribute_t structure to 'type'
