- Guard against no-op kernel launches resulting in potential hipGetLastError

##### Changed

- Default verbosity of rocblas-test reduced. To see all tests set environment variable GTEST_LISTENER=PASS_LINE_IN_LOG

#### rocFFT 1.0.25

rocFFT 1.0.25 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Added

- Implemented experimental APIs to allow computing FFTs on data distributed across multiple devices in a single process.

  `rocfft_field` is a new type that can be added to a plan description, to describe layout of FFT input or output.  `rocfft_field_add_brick` can be called one or more times to describe a brick decomposition of an FFT field, where each brick can be assigned a different device.

  These interfaces are still experimental and subject to change.  We are interested to hear feedback on them.  Questions and concerns may be raised by opening issues on the [rocFFT issue tracker](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocFFT/issues).

  Note that at this time, multi-device FFTs have several limitations:

  * Real-complex (forward or inverse) FFTs are not currently supported.
  * Planar format fields are not currently supported.
  * Batch (i.e. `number_of_transforms` provided to `rocfft_plan_create`) must be 1.
  * The FFT input is gathered to the current device at execute time, so all of the FFT data must fit on that device.

  We expect these limitations to be removed in future releases.

##### Optimizations

- Improved performance of some small 2D/3D real FFTs supported by 2D_SINGLE kernel. gfx90a gets more optimization
  by offline tuning.
- Removed an extra kernel launch from even-length real-complex FFTs that use callbacks.

##### Changed

- Built kernels in solution-map to library kernel cache.
- Real forward transforms (real-to-complex) no longer overwrite input.  rocFFT still may overwrite real inverse (complex-to-real) input, as this allows for faster performance.

- rocfft-rider and dyna-rocfft-rider have been renamed to rocfft-bench and dyna-rocfft-bench, controlled by the
  BUILD_CLIENTS_BENCH CMake option.  Links for the old file names are installed, and the old
  BUILD_CLIENTS_RIDER CMake option is accepted for compatibility but both will be removed in a future release.
- Binaries in debug builds no longer have a &#34;-d&#34; suffix.

##### Fixed

- rocFFT now correctly handles load callbacks that convert data from a smaller data type (e.g. 16-bit integers -&gt; 32-bit float).

#### rocm-cmake 0.11.0

rocm-cmake 0.11.0 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Changed

- ROCMSphinxDoc: Improved validation, documentation and rocm-docs-core integration.

##### Fixed

- ROCMClangTidy: Fixed extra make flags passed for clang tidy.
- ROCMTest: Fixed issues when using module in a subdirectory.

#### rocPRIM 3.0.0

rocPRIM 3.0.0 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Added

- `block_sort::sort()` overload for keys and values with a dynamic size, for all block sort algorithms. Additionally, all `block_sort::sort()` overloads with a dynamic size are now supported for `block_sort_algorithm::merge_sort` and `block_sort_algorithm::bitonic_sort`.
- New two-way partition primitive `partition_two_way` which can write to two separate iterators.

##### Optimizations

- Improved the performance of `partition`.

##### Fixed

- Fixed `rocprim::MatchAny` for devices with 64-bit warp size. The function `rocprim::MatchAny` is deprecated and `rocprim::match_any` is preferred instead.

#### rocRAND 2.10.17

rocRAND 2.10.17 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Added

- MT19937 pseudo random number generator based on M. Matsumoto and T. Nishimura, 1998, Mersenne Twister: A 623-dimensionally equidistributed uniform pseudorandom number generator.
- New benchmark for the device API using Google Benchmark, `benchmark_rocrand_device_api`, replacing `benchmark_rocrand_kernel`. `benchmark_rocrand_kernel` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Likewise, `benchmark_curand_host_api` is added to replace `benchmark_curand_generate` and `benchmark_curand_device_api` is added to replace `benchmark_curand_kernel`.
- experimental HIP-CPU feature
- ThreeFry pseudorandom number generator based on Salmon et al., 2011, &#34;Parallel random numbers: as easy as 1, 2, 3&#34;.
- Accessor methods for sobol 32 and 64 direction vectors and constants:
  - Enum `rocrand_direction_vector_set` to select the direction vector set.
  - `rocrand_get_direction_vectors32(...)` supersedes:
    - `rocrand_h_sobol32_direction_vectors` 
    - `rocrand_h_scrambled_sobol32_direction_vectors`
  - `rocrand_get_direction_vectors64(...)` supersedes:
    - `rocrand_h_sobol64_direction_vectors` 
    - `rocrand_h_scrambled_sobol64_direction_vectors`
  - `rocrand_get_scramble_constants32(...)` supersedes `h_scrambled_sobol32_constants`
  - `rocrand_get_scramble_constants64(...)` supersedes `h_scrambled_sobol64_constants`

rocThrust 3.0.0 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Added

- Updated to match upstream Thrust 2.0.1
- NV_IF_TARGET macro from libcu++ for NVIDIA backend and HIP implementation for HIP backend.

##### Changed

- The cmake build system now additionally accepts `GPU_TARGETS` in addition to `AMDGPU_TARGETS` for
  setting the targeted gpu architectures. `GPU_TARGETS=all` will compile for all supported architectures.
  `AMDGPU_TARGETS` is only provided for backwards compatibility, `GPU_TARGETS` should be preferred.

##### Removed

- Removed cub symlink from the root of the repository.
- Removed support for deprecated macros (THRUST_DEVICE_BACKEND and THRUST_HOST_BACKEND).

##### Known Issues

- For NVIDIA backend, `NV_IF_TARGET` and `THRUST_RDC_ENABLED` intend to substitute the `THRUST_HAS_CUDART` macro, which is now no longer used in Thrust (provided for legacy support only). However, there is no `THRUST_RDC_ENABLED` macro available for the HIP backend, so some branches in Thrust&#39;s code may be unreachable in the HIP backend.

## ROCm 5.7.1
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable no-duplicate-header -->

### What's new in this release

ROCm 5.7.1 is a point release with several bug fixes in the HIP runtime.

#### Installing all GPU AddressSanitizer packages with a single command

ROCm 5.7.1 simplifies the installation steps for the optional AddressSanitizer (ASan) packages. This
release provides the meta package *rocm-ml-sdk-asan* for ease of ASan installation. The following
command can be used to install all ASan packages rather than installing each package separately,

        sudo apt-get install rocm-ml-sdk-asan

For more detailed information about using the GPU AddressSanitizer, refer to the
[user guide](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-5.7.1/understand/using_gpu_sanitizer.html)

### ROCm libraries

#### rocBLAS
A new functionality rocblas-gemm-tune and an environment variable
ROCBLAS_TENSILE_GEMM_OVERRIDE_PATH are added to rocBLAS in the ROCm 5.7.1 release.

`rocblas-gemm-tune` is used to find the best-performing GEMM kernel for each GEMM problem set. It
has a command line interface, which mimics the --yaml input used by rocblas-bench. To generate the
expected --yaml input, profile logging can be used, by setting the environment variable
ROCBLAS_LAYER4.

For more information on rocBLAS logging, see Logging in rocBLAS, in the
[API Reference Guide](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocBLAS/en/docs-5.7.1/API_Reference_Guide.html#logging-in-rocblas).

An example input file: Expected output (note selected GEMM idx may differ): Where the far right values
(solution_index) are the indices of the best-performing kernels for those GEMMs in the rocBLAS kernel
library. These indices can be directly used in future GEMM calls. See
` rocBLAS/samples/example_user_driven_tuning.cpp` for sample code of directly using kernels via their
indices.

If the output is stored in a file, the results can be used to override default kernel selection with the
kernels found by setting the environment variable ROCBLAS_TENSILE_GEMM_OVERRIDE_PATH, which
points to the stored file.

For more details, refer to the
[rocBLAS Programmer's Guide](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocBLAS/en/latest/Programmers_Guide.html#rocblas-gemm-tune).

#### HIP 5.7.1 (for ROCm 5.7.1)

ROCm 5.7.1 is a point release with several bug fixes in the HIP runtime.

### Defect fixes

The `hipPointerGetAttributes` API returns the correct HIP memory type as `hipMemoryTypeManaged`
for managed memory.

## ROCm 5.7.0
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable no-duplicate-header -->

### Release highlights for ROCm 5.7

New features include:

* A new library (hipTensor)
* Optimizations for rocRAND and MIVisionX
* AddressSanitizer for host and device code (GPU) is now available as a beta

Note that ROCm 5.7.0 is EOS for MI50. 5.7 versions of ROCm are the last major releases in the ROCm 5
series. This release is Linux-only.

```important
The next major ROCm release (ROCm 6.0) will not be backward compatible with the ROCm 5 series.
Changes will include: splitting LLVM packages into more manageable sizes, changes to the HIP runtime
API, splitting rocRAND and hipRAND into separate packages, and reorganizing our file structure.
```

#### AMD Instinct™ MI50 end-of-support notice

AMD Instinct MI50, Radeon Pro VII, and Radeon VII products (collectively gfx906 GPUs) will enter
maintenance mode starting Q3 2023.

As outlined in [5.6.0](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-5.6.0/release.html), ROCm 5.7 will be the
final release for gfx906 GPUs to be in a fully supported state.

* ROCm 6.0 release will show MI50s as "under maintenance" for
  [Linux](../about/compatibility/linux-support.md) and
  [Windows](../about/compatibility/windows-support.md)

* No new features and performance optimizations will be supported for the gfx906 GPUs beyond this
  major release (ROCm 5.7).

* Bug fixes and critical security patches will continue to be supported for the gfx906 GPUs until Q2
  2024 (end of maintenance \[EOM] will be aligned with the closest ROCm release).

* Bug fixes during the maintenance will be made to the next ROCm point release.

* Bug fixes will not be backported to older ROCm releases for gfx906.

* Distribution and operating system updates will continue per the ROCm release cadence for gfx906
  GPUs until EOM.

#### Feature updates

##### Non-hostcall HIP printf

**Current behavior**

The current version of HIP printf relies on hostcalls, which, in turn, rely on PCIe atomics. However, PCle
atomics are unavailable in some environments, and, as a result, HIP-printf does not work in those
environments. Users may see the following error from runtime (with AMD_LOG_LEVEL 1 and above):

```shell
    Pcie atomics not enabled, hostcall not supported
```

**Workaround**

The ROCm 5.7 release introduces an alternative to the current hostcall-based implementation that
leverages an older OpenCL-based printf scheme, which does not rely on hostcalls/PCIe atomics.

Note: This option is less robust than hostcall-based implementation and is intended to be a
workaround when hostcalls do not work.

The printf variant is now controlled via a new compiler option -mprintf-kind=<value>. This is
supported only for HIP programs and takes the following values,

* “hostcall” – This currently available implementation relies on hostcalls, which require the system to
  support PCIe atomics. It is the default scheme.

* “buffered” – This implementation leverages the older printf scheme used by OpenCL; it relies on a
  memory buffer where printf arguments are stored during the kernel execution, and then the runtime
  handles the actual printing once the kernel finishes execution.

**NOTE**: With the new workaround:

* The printf buffer is fixed size and non-circular.  After the buffer is filled, calls to printf will not result in
  additional output.

* The printf call returns either 0 (on success) or -1 (on failure, due to full buffer), unlike the hostcall
  scheme that returns the number of characters printed.

##### Beta release of LLVM AddressSanitizer (ASan) with the GPU

The ROCm 5.7 release introduces the beta release of LLVM AddressSanitizer (ASan) with the GPU. The
LLVM ASan provides a process that allows developers to detect runtime addressing errors in
applications and libraries. The detection is achieved using a combination of compiler-added
instrumentation and runtime techniques, including function interception and replacement.

Until now, the LLVM ASan process was only available for traditional purely CPU applications. However,
ROCm has extended this mechanism to additionally allow the detection of some addressing errors on
the GPU in heterogeneous applications. Ideally, developers should treat heterogeneous HIP and
OpenMP applications like pure CPU applications. However, this simplicity has not been achieved yet.

Refer to the documentation on LLVM ASan with the GPU at
[LLVM AddressSanitizer User Guide](../conceptual/using_gpu_sanitizer.md).

```note
The beta release of LLVM ASan for ROCm is currently tested and validated on Ubuntu 20.04.
```

#### Defect fixes

The following defects are fixed in ROCm v5.7:

* Test hangs observed in HMM RCCL

* NoGpuTst test of Catch2 fails with Docker

* Failures observed with non-HMM HIP directed catch2 tests with XNACK+

* Multiple test failures and test hangs observed in hip-directed catch2 tests with xnack+

    * `hipMipmappedArrayCreate` for creating a mipmapped array

    * `hipMipmappedArrayDestroy` for destroy a mipmapped array

    * `hipMipmappedArrayGetLevel` for getting a mipmapped array on a mipmapped level

##### Changes

* Improved performances when handling the end of a process with a large number of threads.

#### Known issues

* On certain configurations, ROCgdb can show the following warning message:

  `warning: Probes-based dynamic linker interface failed. Reverting to original interface.`

  This does not affect ROCgdb's functionalities.

### ROCprofiler (for ROCm 5.6.0)

In ROCm 5.6 the `rocprofilerv1` and `rocprofilerv2` include and library files of
ROCm 5.5 are split into separate files. The `rocmtools` files that were
deprecated in ROCm 5.5 have been removed.

  | ROCm 5.6        | rocprofilerv1                       | rocprofilerv2                          |
  |-----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
  | **Tool script** | `bin/rocprof`                       | `bin/rocprofv2`                        |
  | **API include** | `include/rocprofiler/rocprofiler.h` | `include/rocprofiler/v2/rocprofiler.h` |
  | **API library** | `lib/librocprofiler.so.1`           | `lib/librocprofiler.so.2`              |

The ROCm Profiler Tool that uses `rocprofilerV1` can be invoked using the
following command:

```sh
rocprof …
```

To write a custom tool based on the `rocprofilerV1` API do the following:

```C
main.c:
#include <rocprofiler/rocprofiler.h> // Use the rocprofilerV1 API
int main() {
  // Use the rocprofilerV1 API
  return 0;
}
```

This can be built in the following manner:

```sh
gcc main.c -I/opt/rocm-5.6.0/include -L/opt/rocm-5.6.0/lib -lrocprofiler64
```

The resulting `a.out` will depend on
`/opt/rocm-5.6.0/lib/librocprofiler64.so.1`.

The ROCm Profiler that uses `rocprofilerV2` API can be invoked using the
following command:

```sh
rocprofv2 …
```

To write a custom tool based on the `rocprofilerV2` API do the following:

```C
main.c:
#include <rocprofiler/v2/rocprofiler.h> // Use the rocprofilerV2 API
int main() {
  // Use the rocprofilerV2 API
  return 0;
}
```

This can be built in the following manner:

```sh
gcc main.c -I/opt/rocm-5.6.0/include -L/opt/rocm-5.6.0/lib -lrocprofiler64-v2
```

The resulting `a.out` will depend on
`/opt/rocm-5.6.0/lib/librocprofiler64.so.2`.

#### Optimizations

* Improved Test Suite

#### Additions

* 'end_time' need to be disabled in roctx_trace.txt

#### Fixes

* rocprof in ROcm/5.4.0 gpu selector broken.
* rocprof in ROCm/5.4.1 fails to generate kernel info.
* rocprof clobbers LD_PRELOAD.

## ROCm 5.5.0
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable no-duplicate-header -->
### What's new in this release

#### HIP enhancements

The ROCm v5.5 release consists of the following HIP enhancements:

##### Enhanced stack size limit

In this release, the stack size limit is increased from 16k to 131056 bytes (or 128K - 16).
Applications requiring to update the stack size can use hipDeviceSetLimit API.

##### `hipcc` changes

The following hipcc changes are implemented in this release:

* `hipcc` will not implicitly link to `libpthread` and `librt`, as they are no longer a link time dependence
  for HIP programs.  Applications that depend on these libraries must explicitly link to them.
* `-use-staticlib` and `-use-sharedlib` options are deprecated.

##### Future changes

* Separation of `hipcc` binaries (Perl scripts) from HIP to `hipcc` project. Users will access separate
  `hipcc` package for installing `hipcc` binaries in future ROCm releases.

* In a future ROCm release, the following samples will be removed from the `hip-tests` project.
  * `hipBusbandWidth` at <https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hip-tests/tree/develop/samples/1_Utils/shipBusBandwidth>
  * `hipCommander` at <https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hip-tests/tree/develop/samples/1_Utils/hipCommander>

  Note that the samples will continue to be available in previous release branches.
* Removal of gcnarch from hipDeviceProp_t structure
* Addition of new fields in hipDeviceProp_t structure
  * maxTexture1D
  * maxTexture2D
  * maxTexture1DLayered
  * maxTexture2DLayered
  * sharedMemPerMultiprocessor
  * deviceOverlap
  * asyncEngineCount
  * surfaceAlignment
  * unifiedAddressing
  * computePreemptionSupported
  * hostRegisterSupported
  * uuid
* Removal of deprecated code
  * hip-hcc codes from hip code tree
* Correct hipArray usage in HIP APIs such as hipMemcpyAtoH and hipMemcpyHtoA
* HIPMEMCPY_3D fields correction to avoid truncation of "size_t" to "unsigned int" inside hipMemcpy3D()
* Renaming of 'memoryType' in hipPointerAttribute_t structure to 'type'
* Correct hipGetLastError to return the last error instead of last API call's return code
* Update hipExternalSemaphoreHandleDesc to add "unsigned int reserved\[16]"
* Correct handling of flag values in hipIpcOpenMemHandle for hipIpcMemLazyEnablePeerAccess
* Remove hiparray* and make it opaque with hipArray_t

##### New HIP APIs in this release

```note
This is a pre-official version (beta) release of the new APIs and may contain unresolved issues.
```

###### Memory management HIP APIs

The new memory management HIP API is as follows:

* Sets information on the specified pointer \[BETA].

  ```cpp
  hipError_t hipPointerSetAttribute(const void* value, hipPointer_attribute attribute, hipDeviceptr_t ptr);
  ```

###### Module management HIP APIs

The new module management HIP APIs are as follows:

* Launches kernel $f$ with launch parameters and shared memory on stream with arguments passed
  to `kernelParams`, where thread blocks can cooperate and synchronize as they run.

  ```cpp
  hipError_t hipModuleLaunchCooperativeKernel(hipFunction_t f, unsigned int gridDimX, unsigned int gridDimY, unsigned int gridDimZ, unsigned int blockDimX, unsigned int blockDimY, unsigned int blockDimZ, unsigned int sharedMemBytes, hipStream_t stream, void** kernelParams);
  ```

* Launches kernels on multiple devices where thread blocks can cooperate and synchronize as they
  run.

  ```cpp
  hipError_t hipModuleLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice(hipFunctionLaunchParams* launchParamsList, unsigned int numDevices, unsigned int flags);
  ```

###### HIP graph management APIs

The new HIP graph management APIs are as follows:

* Creates a memory allocation node and adds it to a graph \[BETA]

  ```cpp
  hipError_t hipGraphAddMemAllocNode(hipGraphNode_t* pGraphNode, hipGraph_t graph, const hipGraphNode_t* pDependencies, size_t numDependencies, hipMemAllocNodeParams* pNodeParams);
  ```

* Return parameters for memory allocation node \[BETA]

  ```cpp
  hipError_t hipGraphMemAllocNodeGetParams(hipGraphNode_t node, hipMemAllocNodeParams* pNodeParams);
  ```

* Creates a memory free node and adds it to a graph \[BETA]

  ```cpp
  hipError_t hipGraphAddMemFreeNode(hipGraphNode_t* pGraphNode, hipGraph_t graph, const hipGraphNode_t* pDependencies, size_t numDependencies, void* dev_ptr);
  ```

* Returns parameters for memory free node \[BETA].

  ```cpp
  hipError_t hipGraphMemFreeNodeGetParams(hipGraphNode_t node, void* dev_ptr);
  ```

* Write a DOT file describing graph structure \[BETA].

  ```cpp
  hipError_t hipGraphDebugDotPrint(hipGraph_t graph, const char* path, unsigned int flags);
  ```

* Copies attributes from source node to destination node \[BETA].

  ```cpp
  hipError_t hipGraphKernelNodeCopyAttributes(hipGraphNode_t hSrc, hipGraphNode_t hDst);
  ```

* Enables or disables the specified node in the given graphExec \[BETA]

  ```cpp
  hipError_t hipGraphNodeSetEnabled(hipGraphExec_t hGraphExec, hipGraphNode_t hNode, unsigned int isEnabled);
  ```

* Query whether a node in the given graphExec is enabled \[BETA]

  ```cpp
  hipError_t hipGraphNodeGetEnabled(hipGraphExec_t hGraphExec, hipGraphNode_t hNode, unsigned int* isEnabled);
  ```

##### OpenMP enhancements

This release consists of the following OpenMP enhancements:

* Additional support for OMPT functions `get_device_time` and `get_record_type`
* Added support for min/max fast fp atomics on AMD GPUs
* Fixed the use of the abs function in C device regions

### Deprecations and warnings

#### HIP deprecation

The `hipcc` and `hipconfig` Perl scripts are deprecated. In a future release, compiled binaries will be
available as `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` as replacements for the Perl scripts.

```note
There will be a transition period where the Perl scripts and compiled binaries are available before the
scripts are removed. There will be no functional difference between the Perl scripts and their compiled
binary counterpart. No user action is required. Once these are available, users can optionally switch to
`hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin`. The `hipcc`/`hipconfig` soft link will be assimilated to point from
`hipcc`/`hipconfig` to the respective compiled binaries as the default option.
```

##### Linux file system hierarchy standard for ROCm

ROCm packages have adopted the Linux foundation file system hierarchy standard in this release to ensure ROCm components follow open source conventions for Linux-based distributions. While moving to a new file system hierarchy, ROCm ensures backward compatibility with its 5.1 version or older file system hierarchy. See below for a detailed explanation of the new file system hierarchy and backward compatibility.

##### New file system hierarchy

The following is the new file system hierarchy:4

```text
/opt/rocm-<ver>
    | --bin
      | --All externally exposed Binaries
    | --libexec
        | --<component>
            | -- Component specific private non-ISA executables (architecture independent)
    | --include
        | -- <component>
            | --<header files>
    | --lib
        | --lib<soname>.so -> lib<soname>.so.major -> lib<soname>.so.major.minor.patch
            (public libraries linked with application)
        | --<component> (component specific private library, executable data)
        | --<cmake>
            | --components
                | --<component>.config.cmake
    | --share
        | --html/<component>/*.html
        | --info/<component>/*.[pdf, md, txt]
        | --man
        | --doc
            | --<component>
                | --<licenses>
        | --<component>
            | --<misc files> (arch independent non-executable)
            | --samples

```

```note
ROCm will not support backward compatibility with the v5.1(old) file system hierarchy in its next major
release.
```

For more information, refer to <https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml>.

##### Backward compatibility with older file systems

ROCm has moved header files and libraries to its new location as indicated in the above structure and
included symbolic-link and wrapper header files in its old location for backward compatibility.

> **Note**
>
> ROCm will continue supporting backward compatibility until the next major release.

##### Wrapper header files

Wrapper header files are placed in the old location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/include`) with a
warning message to include files from the new location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/include`) as shown in the
example below:

```cpp
// Code snippet from hip_runtime.h
#pragma message “This file is deprecated. Use file from include path /opt/rocm-ver/include/ and prefix with hip”.
#include "hip/hip_runtime.h"
```

The wrapper header files’ backward compatibility deprecation is as follows:

* `#pragma` message announcing deprecation -- ROCm v5.2 release
* `#pragma` message changed to `#warning` -- Future release
* `#warning` changed to `#error` -- Future release
* Backward compatibility wrappers removed -- Future release

##### Library files

Library files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib` folder. For backward compatibility, the old library
location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib`) has a soft link to the library at the new location.

Example:

```bash

## ROCm 5.4.3
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
### Deprecations and warnings

#### HIP Perl scripts deprecation

The `hipcc` and `hipconfig` Perl scripts are deprecated. In a future release, compiled binaries will be
available as `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` as replacements for the Perl scripts.

```note
There will be a transition period where the Perl scripts and compiled binaries are available before the
scripts are removed. There will be no functional difference between the Perl scripts and their compiled
binary counterpart. No user action is required. Once these are available, users can optionally switch to
`hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin`. The `hipcc`/`hipconfig` soft link will be assimilated to point from
`hipcc`/`hipconfig` to the respective compiled binaries as the default option.
```

##### Linux file system hierarchy standard for ROCm

ROCm packages have adopted the Linux foundation file system hierarchy standard in this release to
ensure ROCm components follow open source conventions for Linux-based distributions. While
moving to a new file system hierarchy, ROCm ensures backward compatibility with its 5.1 version or
older file system hierarchy. See below for a detailed explanation of the new file system hierarchy and
backward compatibility.

##### New file system hierarchy

The following is the new file system hierarchy:4

```text
/opt/rocm-<ver>
    | --bin
      | --All externally exposed Binaries
    | --libexec
        | --<component>
            | -- Component specific private non-ISA executables (architecture independent)
    | --include
        | -- <component>
            | --<header files>
    | --lib
        | --lib<soname>.so -> lib<soname>.so.major -> lib<soname>.so.major.minor.patch
            (public libraries linked with application)
        | --<component> (component specific private library, executable data)
        | --<cmake>
            | --components
                | --<component>.config.cmake
    | --share
        | --html/<component>/*.html
        | --info/<component>/*.[pdf, md, txt]
        | --man
        | --doc
            | --<component>
                | --<licenses>
        | --<component>
            | --<misc files> (arch independent non-executable)
            | --samples

```

```note
ROCm will not support backward compatibility with the v5.1(old) file system hierarchy in its next major
release.
```

For more information, refer to <https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml>.

##### Backward compatibility with older file systems

ROCm has moved header files and libraries to its new location as indicated in the above structure and
included symbolic-link and wrapper header files in its old location for backward compatibility.

```note
ROCm will continue supporting backward compatibility until the next major release.
```

##### Wrapper header files

Wrapper header files are placed in the old location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/include`) with a
warning message to include files from the new location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/include`) as shown in the
example below:

```cpp
// Code snippet from hip_runtime.h
#pragma message “This file is deprecated. Use file from include path /opt/rocm-ver/include/ and prefix with hip”.
#include "hip/hip_runtime.h"
```

The wrapper header files’ backward compatibility deprecation is as follows:

* `#pragma` message announcing deprecation -- ROCm v5.2 release
* `#pragma` message changed to `#warning` -- Future release
* `#warning` changed to `#error` -- Future release
* Backward compatibility wrappers removed -- Future release

##### Library files

Library files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib` folder. For backward compatibility, the old library
location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib`) has a soft link to the library at the new location.

Example:

```bash
$ ls -l /opt/rocm/hip/lib/
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 May 12 10:45 cmake
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   24 May 10 23:32 libamdhip64.so -> ../../lib/libamdhip64.so
```

##### CMake config files

All CMake configuration files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib/cmake/<component>` folder. For
backward compatibility, the old CMake locations (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib/cmake`) consist of
a soft link to the new CMake config.

Example:

```bash
$ ls -l /opt/rocm/hip/lib/cmake/hip/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 42 May 10 23:32 hip-config.cmake -> ../../../../lib/cmake/hip/hip-config.cmake
```

### Defect fixes

#### Compiler improvements

In ROCm v5.4.3, improvements to the compiler address errors with the following signatures:

* "error: unhandled SGPR spill to memory"
* "cannot scavenge register without an emergency spill slot!"
* "error: ran out of registers during register allocation"

### Known issues

#### Compiler option error at runtime

Some users may encounter a “Cannot find Symbol” error at runtime when using `-save-temps`. While
most `-save-temps` use cases work correctly, this error may appear occasionally.

This issue is under investigation, and the known workaround is not to use `-save-temps` when the error
appears.

## ROCm 5.4.2
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
### Deprecations and warnings

#### HIP Perl scripts deprecation

The `hipcc` and `hipconfig` Perl scripts are deprecated. In a future release, compiled binaries will be
available as `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` as replacements for the Perl scripts.

```note
There will be a transition period where the Perl scripts and compiled binaries are available  before the
scripts are removed. There will be no functional difference between the Perl scripts and their compiled
binary counterpart. No user action is required. Once these are available, users can optionally switch to
`hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin`. The `hipcc`/`hipconfig` soft link will be assimilated to point from
`hipcc`/`hipconfig` to the respective compiled binaries as the default option.
```

#### `hipcc` options deprecation

The following hipcc options are being deprecated and will be removed in a future release:

* The `--amdgpu-target` option is being deprecated, and user must use the `–offload-arch` option to
  specify the GPU architecture.
* The `--amdhsa-code-object-version` option is being deprecated.  Users can use the Clang/LLVM
  option `-mllvm -mcode-object-version` to debug issues related to code object versions.
* The `--hipcc-func-supp`/`--hipcc-no-func-supp` options are being deprecated, as the function calls
  are already supported in production on AMD GPUs.

### Known issues

Under certain circumstances typified by high register pressure, users may encounter a compiler abort
with one of the following error messages:

* > `error: unhandled SGPR spill to memory`

* > `cannot scavenge register without an emergency spill slot!`

* > `error: ran out of registers during register allocation`

This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future release.

### What's new in this release

#### HIP enhancements

The ROCm v5.4.1 release consists of the following new HIP API:

##### New HIP API - hipLaunchHostFunc

The following new HIP API is introduced in the ROCm v5.4.1 release.

> **Note**
>
> This is a pre-official version (beta) release of the new APIs.

```cpp
hipError_t hipLaunchHostFunc(hipStream_t stream, hipHostFn_t fn, void* userData);
```

This swaps the stream capture mode of a thread.

```text
@param [in] mode - Pointer to mode value to swap with the current mode
```

This parameter returns `#hipSuccess`, `#hipErrorInvalidValue`.

For more information, refer to the HIP API documentation at
/bundle/HIP_API_Guide/page/modules.html.

### Deprecations and warnings

#### HIP Perl scripts deprecation

The `hipcc` and `hipconfig` Perl scripts are deprecated. In a future release, compiled binaries will be
available as `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` as replacements for the Perl scripts.

<!-- markdownlint-disable no-duplicate-header -->
### What's new in this release

#### HIP enhancements

The ROCm v5.4 release consists of the following HIP enhancements:

##### Support for wall_clock64

A new timer function wall_clock64() is supported, which returns wall clock count at a constant
frequency on the device.

```cpp
long long int wall_clock64();
```

It returns wall clock count at a constant frequency on the device, which can be queried via HIP API with
the hipDeviceAttributeWallClockRate attribute of the device in the HIP application code.

Example:

```cpp
int wallClkRate = 0; //in kilohertz
+HIPCHECK(hipDeviceGetAttribute(&wallClkRate, hipDeviceAttributeWallClockRate, deviceId));
```

Where hipDeviceAttributeWallClockRate is a device attribute.

```note
The wall clock frequency is a per-device attribute.
```

##### New registry added for GPU_MAX_HW_QUEUES

The GPU_MAX_HW_QUEUES registry defines the maximum number of independent hardware queues
allocated per process per device.

The environment variable controls how many independent hardware queues HIP runtime can create
per process, per device. If the application allocates more HIP streams than this number, then the HIP
runtime reuses the same hardware queues for the new streams in a round-robin manner.

```note
This maximum number does not apply to hardware queues created for CU-masked HIP streams or
cooperative queues for HIP Cooperative Groups (there is only one queue per device).
```

For more details, refer to the HIP Programming Guide.

#### New HIP APIs in this release

The following new HIP APIs are available in the ROCm v5.4 release.

> **Note**
>
> This is a pre-official version (beta) release of the new APIs.

##### Error handling

```cpp
hipError_t hipDrvGetErrorName(hipError_t hipError, const char** errorString);
```

This returns HIP errors in the text string format.

```cpp
hipError_t hipDrvGetErrorString(hipError_t hipError, const char** errorString);
```

This returns text string messages with more details about the error.

For more information, refer to the HIP API Guide.

##### HIP tests source separation

With ROCm v5.4, a separate GitHub project is created at

<https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hip-tests>

This contains HIP catch2 tests and samples, and new tests will continue to develop.

In future ROCm releases, catch2 tests and samples will be removed from the HIP project.

### OpenMP enhancements

This release consists of the following OpenMP enhancements:

* Enable new device RTL in libomptarget as default.
* New flag `-fopenmp-target-fast` to imply `-fopenmp-target-ignore-env-vars -fopenmp-assume-no-thread-state -fopenmp-assume-no-nested-parallelism`.
* Support for the collapse clause and non-unit stride in cases where the no-loop specialized kernel is
  generated.
* Initial implementation of optimized cross-team sum reduction for float and double type scalars.
* Pool-based optimization in the OpenMP runtime to reduce locking during data transfer.

### Deprecations and warnings

#### HIP Perl scripts deprecation

The `hipcc` and `hipconfig` Perl scripts are deprecated. In a future release, compiled binaries will be
available as `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` as replacements for the Perl scripts.

```note
There will be a transition period where the Perl scripts and compiled binaries are available before the
scripts are removed. There will be no functional difference between the Perl scripts and their compiled
binary counterpart. No user action is required. Once these are available, users can optionally switch to
`hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin`. The `hipcc`/`hipconfig` soft link will be assimilated to point from
`hipcc`/`hipconfig` to the respective compiled binaries as the default option.
```

##### Linux file system hierarchy standard for ROCm

ROCm packages have adopted the Linux foundation file system hierarchy standard in this release to
ensure ROCm components follow open source conventions for Linux-based distributions. While
moving to a new file system hierarchy, ROCm ensures backward compatibility with its 5.1 version or
older file system hierarchy. See below for a detailed explanation of the new file system hierarchy and
backward compatibility.

##### New file system hierarchy

The following is the new file system hierarchy:

```text
/opt/rocm-<ver>
    | --bin
      | --All externally exposed Binaries
    | --libexec
        | --<component>
            | -- Component specific private non-ISA executables (architecture independent)
    | --include
        | -- <component>
            | --<header files>
    | --lib
        | --lib<soname>.so -> lib<soname>.so.major -> lib<soname>.so.major.minor.patch
            (public libraries linked with application)
        | --<component> (component specific private library, executable data)
        | --<cmake>
            | --components
                | --<component>.config.cmake
    | --share
        | --html/<component>/*.html
        | --info/<component>/*.[pdf, md, txt]
        | --man
        | --doc
            | --<component>
                | --<licenses>
        | --<component>
            | --<misc files> (arch independent non-executable)
            | --samples

```

```note
ROCm will not support backward compatibility with the v5.1(old) file system hierarchy in its next major
release.
```

For more information, refer to <https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml>.

##### Backward compatibility with older file systems

ROCm has moved header files and libraries to its new location as indicated in the above structure and
included symbolic-link and wrapper header files in its old location for backward compatibility.

```note
ROCm will continue supporting backward compatibility until the next major release.
```

##### Wrapper header files

Wrapper header files are placed in the old location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/include`) with a
warning message to include files from the new location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/include`) as shown in the
example below:

```cpp
// Code snippet from hip_runtime.h
#pragma message “This file is deprecated. Use file from include path /opt/rocm-ver/include/ and prefix with hip”.
#include "hip/hip_runtime.h"
```

The wrapper header files’ backward compatibility deprecation is as follows:

* `#pragma` message announcing deprecation -- ROCm v5.2 release
* `#pragma` message changed to `#warning` -- Future release
* `#warning` changed to `#error` -- Future release
* Backward compatibility wrappers removed -- Future release

##### Library files

Library files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib` folder. For backward compatibility, the old library
location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib`) has a soft link to the library at the new location.

Example:

```bash
$ ls -l /opt/rocm/hip/lib/
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 May 12 10:45 cmake
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   24 May 10 23:32 libamdhip64.so -> ../../lib/libamdhip64.so
```

##### CMake config files

All CMake configuration files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib/cmake/<component>` folder. For
backward compatibility, the old CMake locations (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib/cmake`) consist of
a soft link to the new CMake config.

Example:

```bash
$ ls -l /opt/rocm/hip/lib/cmake/hip/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 42 May 10 23:32 hip-config.cmake -> ../../../../lib/cmake/hip/hip-config.cmake
```

### Defect fixes

The following defects are fixed in this release.

These defects were identified and documented as known issues in previous ROCm releases and are
fixed in this release.

#### Memory allocated using hipHostMalloc() with flags didn't exhibit fine-grain behavior

##### Issue

The test was incorrectly using the `hipDeviceAttributePageableMemoryAccess` device attribute to
determine coherent support.

##### Fix

`hipHostMalloc()` allocates memory with fine-grained access by default when the environment variable
`HIP_HOST_COHERENT=1` is used.

For more information, refer to {doc}`hip:.doxygen/docBin/html/index`.


#### SoftHang with `hipStreamWithCUMask` test on AMD Instinct™

##### Issue

On GFX10 GPUs, kernel execution hangs when it is launched on streams created using
`hipStreamWithCUMask`.

##### Fix

On GFX10 GPUs, each workgroup processor encompasses two compute units, and the compute units
must be enabled as a pair. The `hipStreamWithCUMask` API unit test cases are updated to set compute
unit mask (cuMask) in pairs for GFX10 GPUs.

#### ROCm tools GPU IDs

The HIP language device IDs are not the same as the GPU IDs reported by the tools. GPU IDs are
globally unique and guaranteed to be consistent across APIs and processes.

GPU IDs reported by ROCTracer and ROCProfiler or ROCm Tools are HSA Driver Node ID of that GPU,
as it is a unique ID for that device in that particular node.

- Vector::GetGhostSize() is deprecated and will be removed
- Multigrid::SetOperatorFormat(unsigned int) is deprecated and will be removed, use Multigrid::SetOperatorFormat(unsigned int, int) instead
- RugeStuebenAMG::SetCouplingStrength(ValueType) is deprecated and will be removed, use SetStrengthThreshold(float) instead

#### rocBLAS 2.46.0

rocBLAS 2.46.0 for ROCm 5.4.0

##### Added

- client smoke test dataset added for quick validation using command rocblas-test --yaml rocblas_smoke.yaml
- Added stream order device memory allocation as a non-default beta option.

##### Optimized

- Improved trsm performance for small sizes by using a substitution method technique
- Improved syr2k and her2k performance significantly by using a block-recursive algorithm

##### Changed

- Level 2, Level 1, and Extension functions: argument checking when the handle is set to rocblas_pointer_mode_host now returns the status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer only for pointers that must be dereferenced based on the alpha and beta argument values.  With handle mode rocblas_pointer_mode_device only pointers that are always dereferenced regardless of alpha and beta values are checked and so may lead to a return status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer.   This improves consistency with legacy BLAS behaviour.
- Add variable to turn on/off ieee16/ieee32 tests for mixed precision gemm
- Allow hipBLAS to select int8 datatype
- Disallow B == C &amp;&amp; ldb != ldc in rocblas_xtrmm_outofplace

##### Fixed

- FORTRAN interfaces generalized for FORTRAN compilers other than gfortran
- fix for trsm_strided_batched rocblas-bench performance gathering
- Fix for rocm-smi path in commandrunner.py script to match ROCm 5.2 and above

#### rocFFT 1.0.19

rocFFT 1.0.19 for ROCm 5.4.0

##### Optimizations

- Optimized some strided large 1D plans.

##### Added

- Added rocfft_plan_description_set_scale_factor API to efficiently multiply each output element of a FFT by a given scaling factor.
- Created a rocfft_kernel_cache.db file next to the installed library. SBCC kernels are moved to this file when built with the library, and are runtime-compiled for new GPU architectures.
- Added gfx1100 and gfx1102 to default AMDGPU_TARGETS.

##### Changed

- Moved runtime compilation cache to in-memory by default.  A default on-disk cache can encounter contention problems 
on multi-node clusters with a shared filesystem.  rocFFT can still be told to use an on-disk cache by setting the 
ROCFFT_RTC_CACHE_PATH environment variable.

#### rocPRIM 2.12.0

rocPRIM 2.12.0 for ROCm 5.4.0

##### Changed

- `device_partition`, `device_unique`, and `device_reduce_by_key` now support problem 
  sizes larger than 2^32 items.

##### Removed

- `block_sort::sort()` overload for keys and values with a dynamic size. This overload was documented but the
  implementation is missing. To avoid further confusion the documentation is removed until a decision is made on
  implementing the function.

##### Fixed

- Fixed the compilation failure in `device_merge` if the two key iterators don&#39;t match.

#### rocRAND 2.10.16

rocRAND 2.10.16 for ROCm 5.4.0

##### Added

- MRG31K3P pseudorandom number generator based on L&#39;Ecuyer and Touzin, 2000, &#34;Fast combined multiple recursive generators with multipliers of the form a = ±2q ±2r&#34;.
- LFSR113 pseudorandom number generator based on L&#39;Ecuyer, 1999, &#34;Tables of maximally equidistributed combined LFSR generators&#34;.
- SCRAMBLED_SOBOL32 and SCRAMBLED_SOBOL64 quasirandom number generators. The Scrambled Sobol sequences are generated by scrambling the output of a Sobol sequence.

##### Changed

- The `mrg_&lt;distribution&gt;_distribution` structures, which provided numbers based on MRG32K3A, are now replaced by `mrg_engine_&lt;distribution&gt;_distribution`, where `&lt;distribution&gt;` is `log_normal`, `normal`, `poisson`, or `uniform`. These structures provide numbers for MRG31K3P (with template type `rocrand_state_mrg31k3p`) and MRG32K3A (with template type `rocrand_state_mrg32k3a`).

##### Fixed

- Sobol64 now returns 64 bits random numbers, instead of 32 bits random numbers. As a result, the performance of this generator has regressed.
- Fixed a bug that prevented compiling code in C++ mode (with a host compiler) when it included the rocRAND headers on Windows.

#### rocSOLVER 3.20.0

rocSOLVER 3.20.0 for ROCm 5.4.0

##### Added

- Partial SVD for bidiagonal matrices:
    - BDSVDX
- Partial SVD for general matrices:
    - GESVDX (with batched and strided\_batched versions)

##### Changed

- Changed `ROCSOLVER_EMBED_FMT` default to `ON` for users building directly with CMake.
  This matches the existing default when building with install.sh or rmake.py.

#### rocSPARSE 2.4.0

rocSPARSE 2.4.0 for ROCm 5.4.0

##### Added

- Added rocsparse_spmv_ex routine

- Optimized bsr2csr routine
- Fixed integer overflow bugs

#### rocThrust 2.17.0

rocThrust 2.17.0 for ROCm 5.4.0

##### Added

- Updated to match upstream Thrust 1.17.0

#### rocWMMA 0.9

rocWMMA 0.9 for ROCm 5.4.0

##### Added

- Added gemm driver APIs for flow control builtins
- Added benchmark logging systems
- Restructured tests to follow naming convention. Added macros for test generation

##### Changed

- Changed CMake to accomodate the modified test infrastructure
- Fine tuned the multi-block kernels with and without lds
- Adjusted Maximum Vector Width to dWordx4 Width
- Updated Efficiencies to display as whole number percentages
- Updated throughput from GFlops/s to TFlops/s
- Reset the ad-hoc tests to use smaller sizes
- Modified the output validation to use CPU-based implementation against rocWMMA

- Improved performance for StoreCInUnroll + b128 store

##### Changed

- Re-enable HardwareMonitor for gfx90a
- Decision trees use MLFeatures instead of Properties

##### Fixed

- Reject DirectToVgpr + MatrixInstBM/BN &gt; 1

<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
### Defect fixes

#### Issue with rocTHRUST and rocPRIM libraries

There was a known issue with rocTHRUST and rocPRIM libraries supporting iterator and types in ROCm
v5.3.x releases.

* `thrust::merge` no longer correctly supports different iterator types for `keys_input1` and
  `keys_input2`.
* `rocprim::device_merge` no longer correctly supports using different types for `keys_input1` and
  `keys_input2`.

This issue is resolved with the following fixes to compilation failures:

* rocPRIM: in device_merge if the two key iterators do not match.
* rocTHRUST: in thrust::merge if the two key iterators do not match.

#### AMD Instinct™ MI200 SRIOV virtualization issue

There is a known issue in this ROCm v5.3 release with all AMD Instinct™ MI200 devices running within
a virtual function (VF) under SRIOV virtualization. This issue will likely impact the functionality of
SRIOV-based workloads but does not impact Discrete Device Assignment (DDA) or bare metal.

Until a fix is provided, users should rely on ROCm v5.2.3 to support their SRIOV workloads.

#### AMD Instinct™ MI200 firmware updates

Customers cannot update the Integrated Firmware Image (IFWI) for AMD Instinct™ MI200 accelerators.

An updated firmware maintenance bundle consisting of an installation tool and images specific to
AMD Instinct™ MI200 accelerators is under planning and will be available soon.

#### Known issue with rocThrust and rocPRIM libraries

## ROCm 5.3.0
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
### Deprecations and warnings

#### HIP Perl scripts deprecation

The `hipcc` and `hipconfig` Perl scripts are deprecated. In a future release, compiled binaries will be
available as `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` as replacements for the Perl scripts.

```note
There will be a transition period where the Perl scripts and compiled binaries are available  before the
scripts are removed. There will be no functional difference between the Perl scripts and their compiled
binary counterpart. No user action is required. Once these are available, users can optionally switch to
`hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin`. The `hipcc`/`hipconfig` soft link will be assimilated to point from
`hipcc`/`hipconfig` to the respective compiled binaries as the default option.
```

#### Linux file system hierarchy standard for ROCm

ROCm packages have adopted the Linux foundation file system hierarchy standard in this release to
ensure ROCm components follow open source conventions for Linux-based distributions. While
moving to a new file system hierarchy, ROCm ensures backward compatibility with its 5.1 version or
older file system hierarchy. See below for a detailed explanation of the new file system hierarchy and
backward compatibility.

##### New file system hierarchy

The following is the new file system hierarchy:

```text
/opt/rocm-<ver>
    | --bin
      | --All externally exposed Binaries
    | --libexec
        | --<component>
            | -- Component specific private non-ISA executables (architecture independent)
    | --include
        | -- <component>
            | --<header files>
    | --lib
        | --lib<soname>.so -> lib<soname>.so.major -> lib<soname>.so.major.minor.patch
            (public libraries linked with application)
        | --<component> (component specific private library, executable data)
        | --<cmake>
            | --components
                | --<component>.config.cmake
    | --share
        | --html/<component>/*.html
        | --info/<component>/*.[pdf, md, txt]
        | --man
        | --doc
            | --<component>
                | --<licenses>
        | --<component>
            | --<misc files> (arch independent non-executable)
            | --samples

```

```note
ROCm will not support backward compatibility with the v5.1(old) file system hierarchy in its next major
release.
```

For more information, refer to <https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml>.

##### Backward compatibility with older file systems

ROCm has moved header files and libraries to its new location as indicated in the above structure and
included symbolic-link and wrapper header files in its old location for backward compatibility.

```note
ROCm will continue supporting backward compatibility until the next major release.
```

##### Wrapper header files

Wrapper header files are placed in the old location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/include`) with a
warning message to include files from the new location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/include`) as shown in the
example below:

```cpp
// Code snippet from hip_runtime.h
#pragma message “This file is deprecated. Use file from include path /opt/rocm-ver/include/ and prefix with hip”.
#include "hip/hip_runtime.h"
```

The wrapper header files’ backward compatibility deprecation is as follows:

* `#pragma` message announcing deprecation -- ROCm v5.2 release
* `#pragma` message changed to `#warning` -- Future release
* `#warning` changed to `#error` -- Future release
* Backward compatibility wrappers removed -- Future release

##### Library files

Library files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib` folder. For backward compatibility, the old library
location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib`) has a soft link to the library at the new location.

Example:

```bash
$ ls -l /opt/rocm/hip/lib/
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 May 12 10:45 cmake
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   24 May 10 23:32 libamdhip64.so -> ../../lib/libamdhip64.so
```

##### CMake config files

All CMake configuration files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib/cmake/<component>` folder. For
backward compatibility, the old CMake locations (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib/cmake`) consist of
a soft link to the new CMake config.

Example:

```bash
$ ls -l /opt/rocm/hip/lib/cmake/hip/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 42 May 10 23:32 hip-config.cmake -> ../../../../lib/cmake/hip/hip-config.cmake
```

### Defect fixes

The following defects are fixed in this release.

These defects were identified and documented as known issues in previous ROCm releases and are
fixed in the ROCm v5.3 release.

#### Kernel produces incorrect results with ROCm 5.2

User code did not initialize certain data constructs, leading to a correctness issue. A strict reading of
the C++ standard suggests that failing to initialize these data constructs is undefined behavior.
However, a special case was added for a specific compiler builtin to handle the uninitialized data in a
defined manner.

The compiler fix consists of the following patches:

* A new `noundef` attribute is added. This attribute denotes when a function call argument or return
  value may never contain uninitialized bits. For more information, see
  <https://reviews.llvm.org/D81678>
* The application of this attribute was refined such that it was not added to a specific compiler built-in
  where the compiler knows that inactive lanes do not impact program execution. For more
  information, see
  <https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/llvm-project/commit/accf36c58409268ca1f216cdf5ad812ba97ceccd>.

### Known issues

This section consists of known issues in this release.

#### Issue with OpenMP-extras package upgrade

The `openmp-extras` package has been split into runtime (`openmp-extras-runtime`) and dev
(`openmp-extras-devel`) packages. This change has broken the upgrade support for the
`openmp-extras` package in RHEL/SLES.

An available workaround in RHEL is to use the following command for upgrades:

```sh
sudo yum upgrade rocm-language-runtime --allowerasing

```

An available workaround in SLES is to use the following command for upgrades:

```sh
zypper update --force-resolution <meta-package>
```

#### AMD Instinct™ MI200 SRIOV virtualization issue

There is a known issue in this ROCm v5.3 release with all AMD Instinct™ MI200 devices running within
a virtual function (VF) under SRIOV virtualization. This issue will likely impact the functionality of
SRIOV-based workloads, but does not impact Discrete Device Assignment (DDA) or Bare Metal.

Until a fix is provided, users should rely on ROCm v5.2.3 to support their SRIOV workloads.

#### System crash when IMMOU is enabled

If input-output memory management unit (IOMMU) is enabled in SBIOS and ROCm is installed, the
system may report the following failure or errors when running workloads such as bandwidth test,
clinfo, and HelloWord.cl and cause a system crash.

* IO PAGE FAULT
* IRQ remapping does not support X2APIC mode
* NMI error

Workaround: To avoid the system crash, add `amd_iommu=on iommu=pt` as the kernel bootparam, as
indicated in the warning message.

##### Added

- Added --cudapath option to install.sh to allow user to specify which cuda build they would like to use.
- Added --installcuda option to install.sh to install cuda via a package manager. Can be used with new --installcudaversion
  option to specify which version of cuda to install.

##### Fixed

- Fixed #includes to support a compiler version.
- Fixed client dependency support in install.sh

#### hipCUB 2.12.0

hipCUB 2.12.0 for ROCm 5.3.0

##### Added

- UniqueByKey device algorithm
- SubtractLeft, SubtractLeftPartialTile, SubtractRight, SubtractRightPartialTile overloads in BlockAdjacentDifference.
  - The old overloads (FlagHeads, FlagTails, FlagHeadsAndTails) are deprecated.

- Extended benchmark suite of `DeviceHistogram`, `DeviceScan`, `DevicePartition`, `DeviceReduce`,
`DeviceSegmentedReduce`, `DeviceSegmentedRadixSort`, `DeviceRadixSort`, `DeviceSpmv`, `DeviceMergeSort`,
`DeviceSegmentedSort`

##### Changed

- Obsolated type traits defined in util_type.hpp. Use the standard library equivalents instead.
- CUB backend references CUB and thrust version 1.16.0.
- DeviceRadixSort&#39;s num_items parameter&#39;s type is now templated instead of being an int.
  - If an integral type with a size at most 4 bytes is passed (i.e. an int), the former logic applies.

#### hipSPARSE 2.3.1

hipSPARSE 2.3.1 for ROCm 5.3.0

##### Added

- Add SpMM and SpMM batched for CSC format

#### rocALUTION 2.1.0

rocALUTION 2.1.0 for ROCm 5.3.0

##### Added

- Benchmarking tool
- Ext+I Interpolation with sparsify strategies added for RS-AMG

##### Improved

- ParallelManager

#### rocBLAS 2.45.0

rocBLAS 2.45.0 for ROCm 5.3.0

##### Added

- install.sh option --upgrade_tensile_venv_pip to upgrade Pip in Tensile Virtual Environment. The corresponding CMake option is TENSILE_VENV_UPGRADE_PIP.
- install.sh option --relocatable or -r adds rpath and removes ldconf entry on rocBLAS build.
- install.sh option --lazy-library-loading to enable on-demand loading of tensile library files at runtime to speedup rocBLAS initialization.
- Support for RHEL9 and CS9.
- Added Numerical checking routine for symmetric, Hermitian, and triangular matrices, so that they could be checked for any numerical abnormalities such as NaN, Zero, infinity and denormal value.

##### Optimizations

- trmm_outofplace performance improvements for all sizes and data types using block-recursive algorithm.
- herkx performance improvements for all sizes and data types using block-recursive algorithm.
- syrk/herk performance improvements by utilising optimised syrkx/herkx code.
- symm/hemm performance improvements for all sizes and datatypes using block-recursive algorithm.

##### Changed

- Unifying library logic file names: affects HBH (-&gt;HHS_BH), BBH (-&gt;BBS_BH), 4xi8BH (-&gt;4xi8II_BH). All HPA types are using the new naming convention now.
- Level 3 function argument checking when the handle is set to rocblas_pointer_mode_host now returns the status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer only for pointers that must be dereferenced based on the alpha and beta argument values. With handle mode rocblas_pointer_mode_device only pointers that are always dereferenced regardless of alpha and beta values are checked and so may lead to a return status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer. This improves consistency with legacy BLAS behaviour.
- Level 1, 2, and 3 function argument checking for enums is now more rigorously matching legacy BLAS so returns rocblas_status_invalid_value if arguments do not match the accepted subset.
- Add quick-return for internal trmm and gemm template functions.
- Moved function block sizes to a shared header file.
- Level 1, 2, and 3 functions use rocblas_stride datatype for offset.
- Modified the matrix and vector memory allocation in our test infrastructure for all Level 1, 2, 3 and BLAS_EX functions.
- Added specific initialization for symmetric, Hermitian, and triangular matrix types in our test infrastructure.
- Added NaN tests to the test infrastructure for the rest of Level 3, BLAS_EX functions.

##### Fixed

- Improved logic to #include &lt;filesystem&gt; vs &lt;experimental/filesystem&gt;.
- install.sh -s option to build rocblas as a static library.
- dot function now sets the device results asynchronously for N &lt;= 0

##### Deprecated

- is_complex helper is now deprecated.  Use rocblas_is_complex instead.
- The enum truncate_t and the value truncate is now deprecated and will removed from the ROCm release 6.0. It is replaced by rocblas_truncate_t and rocblas_truncate, respectively. The new enum rocblas_truncate_t and the value rocblas_truncate could be used from this ROCm release for an easy transition.

##### Removed

- install.sh options  --hip-clang , --no-hip-clang, --merge-files, --no-merge-files are removed.

#### rocFFT 1.0.18

rocFFT 1.0.18 for ROCm 5.3.0

- Improved performance of the Bluestein algorithm.
- Optimized sbcc-168 and 100 by using half-lds.

##### Fixed

- Fixed occasional failures to parallelize runtime compilation of kernels.
  Failures would be retried serially and ultimately succeed, but this would take extra time.
- Fixed failures of some R2C 3D transforms that use the unsupported TILE_UNALGNED SBRC kernels.
  An example is 98^3 R2C out-of-place.
- Fixed bugs in SBRC_ERC type.

#### rocm-cmake 0.8.0

rocm-cmake 0.8.0 for ROCm 5.3.0

##### Fixed

- Fixed error in prerm scripts created by `rocm_create_package` that could break uninstall for packages using the `PTH` option.

##### Changed

- ROCMInstallTargets now defaults `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` to `lib` if not otherwise specified.
- Changed default Debian compression type to xz and enabled multi-threaded package compression.
- `rocm_create_package` will no longer warn upon failure to determine version of program rpmbuild.

#### rocPRIM 2.11.0

rocPRIM 2.11.0 for ROCm 5.3.0

##### Added

- New functions `subtract_left` and `subtract_right` in `block_adjacent_difference` to apply functions
  on pairs of adjacent items distributed between threads in a block.
- New device level `adjacent_difference` primitives.
- Added experimental tooling for automatic kernel configuration tuning for various architectures

-------------------

## ROCm 5.2.3
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
### Changes in this release

#### Ubuntu 18.04 end-of-life announcement

Support for Ubuntu 18.04 ends in this release. Future releases of ROCm will not provide prebuilt
packages for Ubuntu 18.04.

#### HIP runtime

##### Fixes

* A bug was discovered in the HIP graph capture implementation in the ROCm v5.2.0 release. If the
  same kernel is called twice (with different argument values) in a graph capture, the implementation
  only kept the argument values for the second kernel call.

* A bug was introduced in the hiprtc implementation in the ROCm v5.2.0 release. This bug caused the
  `hiprtcGetLoweredName` call to fail for named expressions with whitespace in it.

Example:

The named expression `my_sqrt<complex<double>>` passed but `my_sqrt<complex<double >>`
failed.

#### RCCL

##### Additions

Compatibility with NCCL 2.12.10

* Packages for test and benchmark executables on all supported OSes using CPack

* Added custom signal handler - opt-in with RCCL_ENABLE_SIGNALHANDLER=1

  * Additional details provided if Binary File Descriptor library (BFD) is pre-installed.

* Added experimental support for using multiple ranks per device

  * Requires using a new interface to create communicator (ncclCommInitRankMulti), refer to the
    interface documentation for details.

  * To avoid potential deadlocks, user might have to set an environment variables increasing the
    number of hardware queues. For example,

```sh
export GPU_MAX_HW_QUEUES=16
```

* Added support for reusing ports in NET/IB channels

  * Opt-in with NCCL_IB_SOCK_CLIENT_PORT_REUSE=1 and NCCL_IB_SOCK_SERVER_PORT_REUSE=1

  * When "Call to bind failed: Address already in use" error happens in large-scale AlltoAll (for example,
    \>=64 MI200 nodes), users are suggested to opt-in either one or both of the options to resolve the
    massive port usage issue

  * Avoid using NCCL_IB_SOCK_SERVER_PORT_REUSE when NCCL_NCHANNELS_PER_NET_PEER is tuned
    \>1

##### Removals

* Removed experimental clique-based kernels

## ROCm 5.2.0
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable no-duplicate-header -->
### What's new in this release

#### HIP enhancements

The ROCm v5.2 release consists of the following HIP enhancements:

##### HIP installation guide updates

The HIP Installation Guide is updated to include building HIP tests from source on the AMD and
NVIDIA platforms.

For more details, refer to the HIP Installation Guide v5.2.

##### Support for device-side malloc on HIP-Clang

HIP-Clang now supports device-side malloc. This implementation does not require the use of
`hipDeviceSetLimit(hipLimitMallocHeapSize,value)` nor respect any setting. The heap is fully dynamic
and can grow until the available free memory on the device is consumed.

The test codes at the following link show how to implement applications using malloc and free
functions in device kernels:

<https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP/blob/develop/tests/src/deviceLib/hipDeviceMalloc.cpp>

For more information, refer to the HIP API documentation at
{doc}`hip:.doxygen/docBin/html/modules`.

##### Planned HIP changes in future releases

Changes to `hipDeviceProp_t`, `HIPMEMCPY_3D`, and `hipArray` structures (and related HIP APIs) are
planned in the next major release. These changes may impact backward compatibility.

Refer to the release notes in subsequent releases for more information.

#### ROCm math and communication libraries

In this release, ROCm math and communication libraries consist of the following enhancements and
fixes:

* New rocWMMA for matrix multiplication and accumulation operations acceleration

This release introduces a new ROCm C++ library for accelerating mixed-precision matrix multiplication
and accumulation (MFMA) operations leveraging specialized GPU matrix cores. rocWMMA provides a
C++ API to facilitate breaking down matrix multiply accumulate problems into fragments and using
them in block-wise operations that are distributed in parallel across GPU wavefronts. The API is a
header library of GPU device code, meaning matrix core acceleration may be compiled directly into
your kernel device code. This can benefit from compiler optimization in the generation of kernel
assembly and does not incur additional overhead costs of linking to external runtime libraries or having
to launch separate kernels.

rocWMMA is released as a header library and includes test and sample projects to validate and
illustrate example usages of the C++ API. GEMM matrix multiplication is used as primary validation
given the heavy precedent for the library. However, the usage portfolio is growing significantly and
demonstrates different ways rocWMMA may be consumed.

For more information, refer to [Communication Libraries](../reference/library-index.md)

#### OpenMP enhancements in this release

##### OMPT target support

The OpenMP runtime in ROCm implements a subset of the OMPT device APIs, as described in the
OpenMP specification document. These are APIs that allow first-party tools to examine the profile
and traces for kernels that execute on a device. A tool may register callbacks for data transfer and
kernel dispatch entry points. A tool may use APIs to start and stop tracing for device-related activities,
such as data transfer and kernel dispatch timings and associated metadata. If device tracing is enabled,
trace records for device activities are collected during program execution and returned to the tool
using the APIs described in the specification.

Following is an example demonstrating how a tool would use the OMPT target APIs supported. The
README in /opt/rocm/llvm/examples/tools/ompt outlines the steps to follow, and you can run the
provided example as indicated below:

```sh
cd /opt/rocm/llvm/examples/tools/ompt/veccopy-ompt-target-tracing
make run
```

The file `veccopy-ompt-target-tracing.c` simulates how a tool would initiate device activity tracing. The
file `callbacks.h` shows the callbacks that may be registered and implemented by the tool.

### Deprecations and warnings

#### Linux file system hierarchy standard for ROCm

ROCm packages have adopted the Linux foundation file system hierarchy standard in this release to
ensure ROCm components follow open source conventions for Linux-based distributions. While
moving to a new file system hierarchy, ROCm ensures backward compatibility with its 5.1 version or
older file system hierarchy. See below for a detailed explanation of the new file system hierarchy and
backward compatibility.

##### New file system hierarchy

The following is the new file system hierarchy:

```text
/opt/rocm-<ver>
    | --bin
      | --All externally exposed Binaries
    | --libexec
        | --<component>
            | -- Component specific private non-ISA executables (architecture independent)
    | --include
        | -- <component>
            | --<header files>
    | --lib
        | --lib<soname>.so -> lib<soname>.so.major -> lib<soname>.so.major.minor.patch
            (public libraries linked with application)
        | --<component> (component specific private library, executable data)
        | --<cmake>
            | --components
                | --<component>.config.cmake
    | --share
        | --html/<component>/*.html
        | --info/<component>/*.[pdf, md, txt]
        | --man
        | --doc
            | --<component>
                | --<licenses>
        | --<component>
            | --<misc files> (arch independent non-executable)
            | --samples

```

```note
ROCm will not support backward compatibility with the v5.1(old) file system hierarchy in its next major
release.
```

For more information, refer to <https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml>.

##### Backward compatibility with older file systems

ROCm has moved header files and libraries to its new location as indicated in the above structure and
included symbolic-link and wrapper header files in its old location for backward compatibility.

```note
ROCm will continue supporting backward compatibility until the next major release.
```
##### Wrapper header files

Wrapper header files are placed in the old location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/include`) with a
warning message to include files from the new location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/include`) as shown in the
example below:

```cpp
// Code snippet from hip_runtime.h
#pragma message “This file is deprecated. Use file from include path /opt/rocm-ver/include/ and prefix with hip”.
#include "hip/hip_runtime.h"
```

The wrapper header files’ backward compatibility deprecation is as follows:

* `#pragma` message announcing deprecation -- ROCm v5.2 release
* `#pragma` message changed to `#warning` -- Future release
* `#warning` changed to `#error` -- Future release
* Backward compatibility wrappers removed -- Future release

##### Library files

Library files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib` folder. For backward compatibility, the old library
location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib`) has a soft link to the library at the new location.

Example:

```bash
$ ls -l /opt/rocm/hip/lib/
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 May 12 10:45 cmake
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   24 May 10 23:32 libamdhip64.so -> ../../lib/libamdhip64.so
```

##### CMake config files

All CMake configuration files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib/cmake/<component>` folder. For
backward compatibility, the old CMake locations (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib/cmake`) consist of
a soft link to the new CMake config.

Example:

```bash
$ ls -l /opt/rocm/hip/lib/cmake/hip/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 42 May 10 23:32 hip-config.cmake -> ../../../../lib/cmake/hip/hip-config.cmake
```

#### Planned deprecation of hip-rocclr and hip-base packages

In the ROCm v5.2 release, hip-rocclr and hip-base packages (Debian and RPM) are planned for
deprecation and will be removed in a future release. hip-runtime-amd and hip-dev(el) will replace
these packages respectively. Users of hip-rocclr must install two packages, hip-runtime-amd and
hip-dev, to get the same set of packages installed by hip-rocclr previously.

Currently, both package names hip-rocclr (or) hip-runtime-amd and hip-base (or) hip-dev(el) are
supported.

#### Deprecation of integrated HIP directed tests

The integrated HIP directed tests, which are currently built by default, are deprecated in this release.
The default building and execution support through CMake will be removed in future release.

### Defect fixes

| Defect |  Fix |
|--------|------|
| ROCmInfo does not list gpus | code fix |
| Hang observed while restoring cooperative group samples | code fix |
| ROCM-SMI over SRIOV: Unsupported commands do not return proper error message | code fix |

### Known issues

This section consists of known issues in this release.

#### Compiler error on gfx1030 when compiling at -O0

##### Issue

A compiler error occurs when using -O0 flag to compile code for gfx1030 that calls atomicAddNoRet,
which is defined in amd_hip_atomic.h. The compiler generates an illegal instruction for gfx1030.

##### Workaround

The workaround is not to use the -O0 flag for this case. For higher optimization levels, the compiler
does not generate an invalid instruction.

#### System freeze observed during CUDA memtest checkpoint

##### Issue

Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace (CRIU) requires 20 MB of VRAM approximately to checkpoint and
restore. The CRIU process may freeze if the maximum amount of available VRAM is allocated to
checkpoint applications.

##### Workaround

To use CRIU to checkpoint and restore your application, limit the amount of VRAM the application uses
to ensure at least 20 MB is available.

#### HPC test fails with the “HSA_STATUS_ERROR_MEMORY_FAULT” error

##### Issue

The compiler may incorrectly compile a program that uses the `__shfl_sync(mask, value, srcLane)`
function when the "value" parameter to the function is undefined along some path to the function. For
most functions, uninitialized inputs cause undefined behavior, but the definition for `__shfl_sync` should
allow for undefined values.

##### Workaround

The workaround is to initialize the parameters to `__shfl_sync`.

```note
When the `-Wall` compilation flag is used, the compiler generates a warning indicating the variable is
initialized along some path.
```

Example:

```cpp
double res = 0.0; // Initialize the input to __shfl_sync.
if (lane == 0) {
  res = <some expression>
}
res = __shfl_sync(mask, res, 0);
```

#### Kernel produces incorrect result

##### Issue

In recent changes to Clang, insertion of the noundef attribute to all the function arguments has been
enabled by default.

In the HIP kernel, variable var in shfl_sync may not be initialized, so LLVM IR treats it as undef.

So, the function argument that is potentially undef (because it is not initialized) has always been
assumed to be noundef by LLVM IR (since Clang has inserted the noundef attribute). This leads to
ambiguous kernel execution.

##### Workaround

* Skip adding `noundef` attribute to functions tagged with convergent  attribute. Refer to
  <https://reviews.llvm.org/D124158> for more information.

* Introduce shuffle attribute and add it to `__shfl` like APIs at hip headers. Clang can skip adding the
  `noundef` attribute, if it finds that argument is tagged with shuffle attribute. Refer to
  <https://reviews.llvm.org/D125378> for more information.

* Introduce clang builtin for `__shfl` to identify it and skip adding `noundef` attribute.

* Introduce `__builtin_freeze` to use on the relevant arguments in library wrappers. The library/header
  need to insert freezes on the relevant inputs.

#### Issue with applications triggering oversubscription

There is a known issue with applications that trigger oversubscription. A hardware hang occurs when
ROCgdb is used on AMD Instinct™ MI50 and MI100 systems.

This issue is under investigation and will be fixed in a future release.

## ROCm 5.1.0
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable no-blanks-blockquote -->
### What's new in this release

#### HIP enhancements

The ROCm v5.1 release consists of the following HIP enhancements.

##### HIP installation guide updates

The HIP installation guide now includes information on installing and building HIP from source on
AMD and NVIDIA platforms.

Refer to the HIP Installation Guide v5.1 for more details.

##### Support for HIP graph

ROCm v5.1 extends support for HIP Graph.

##### Planned changes for HIP in future releases

###### Separation of hiprtc (libhiprtc) library from hip runtime (amdhip64)

On ROCm/Linux, to maintain backward compatibility, the hipruntime library (amdhip64) will continue
to include hiprtc symbols in future releases. The backward compatible support may be discontinued by
removing hiprtc symbols from the hipruntime library (amdhip64) in the next major release.

###### hipDeviceProp_t structure enhancements

Changes to the hipDeviceProp_t structure in the next major release may result in backward
incompatibility. More details on these changes will be provided in subsequent releases.

#### ROCDebugger enhancements

##### Multi-language source-level debugger

The compiler now generates a source-level variable and function argument debug information.

The accuracy is guaranteed if the compiler options `-g -O0` are used and apply only to HIP.

This enhancement enables ROCDebugger users to interact with the HIP source-level variables and
function arguments.

```note
The newly-suggested compiler -g option must be used instead of the previously-suggested `-ggdb`
option. Although the effect of these two options is currently equivalent, this is not guaranteed for the
future, as changes might be made by the upstream LLVM community.
```

##### Machine interface lanes support

ROCDebugger Machine Interface (MI) extends support to lanes, which includes the following
enhancements:

* Added a new -lane-info command, listing the current thread's lanes.

* The -thread-select command now supports a lane switch to switch to a specific lane of a thread:

  ```sh
  -thread-select -l LANE THREAD
  ```

* The =thread-selected notification gained a lane-id attribute. This enables the frontend to know which
  lane of the thread was selected.

* The *stopped asynchronous record gained lane-id and hit-lanes attributes.  The former indicates
  which lane is selected, and the latter indicates which lanes explain the stop.

* MI commands now accept a global --lane option, similar to the global --thread and --frame options.

* MI varobjs are now lane-aware.

For more information, refer to the ROC Debugger User Guide at {doc}`ROCgdb <rocgdb:index>`.

##### Enhanced - clone-inferior command

The clone-inferior command now ensures that the TTY, CMD, ARGS, and AMDGPU PRECISE-MEMORY
settings are copied from the original inferior to the new one.  All modifications to the environment
variables done using the 'set environment' or 'unset environment' commands are also copied to the
new inferior.

#### MIOpen support for RDNA GPUs

This release includes support for AMD Radeon™ Pro W6800, in addition to other bug fixes and
performance improvements as listed below:

* MIOpen now supports RDNA GPUs!! (via MIOpen PRs 973, 780, 764, 740, 739, 677, 660, 653, 493, 498)

* Fixed a correctness issue with ImplicitGemm algorithm

* Updated the performance data for new kernel versions

* Improved MIOpen build time by splitting large kernel header files

* Fixed an issue in reduction kernels for padded tensors

* Various other bug fixes and performance improvements

For more information, see {doc}`Documentation <miopen:index>`.

#### Checkpoint restore support with CRIU

The new Checkpoint Restore in Userspace (CRIU) functionality is implemented to support AMD GPU
and ROCm applications.

CRIU is a userspace tool to Checkpoint and Restore an application.

CRIU lacked the support for checkpoint restore applications that used device files such as a GPU. With
this ROCm release, CRIU is enhanced with a new plugin to support AMD GPUs, which includes:

* Single and Multi GPU systems (Gfx9)
* Checkpoint / Restore on a different system
* Checkpoint / Restore inside a docker container
* PyTorch
* TensorFlow
* Using CRIU Image Streamer

For more information, refer to
<https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/criu/tree/criu-dev/plugins/amdgpu>

```note
The CRIU plugin (amdgpu_plugin) is merged upstream with the CRIU repository. The KFD kernel
patches are also available upstream with the amd-staging-drm-next branch (public) and the ROCm 5.1
release branch.
```

```note
This is a Beta release of the Checkpoint and Restore functionality, and some features are not available
in this release.
```

### Defect fixes

The following defects are fixed in this release.

#### Driver fails to load after installation

The issue with the driver failing to load after ROCm installation is now fixed.

The driver installs successfully, and the server reboots with working rocminfo and clinfo.

#### ROCDebugger defect fixes

##### Breakpoints in GPU kernel code before kernel is loaded

Previously, setting a breakpoint in device code by line number before the device code was loaded into
the program resulted in ROCgdb incorrectly moving the breakpoint to the first following line that
contains host code.

Now, the breakpoint is left pending.  When the GPU kernel gets loaded, the breakpoint resolves to a
location in the kernel.

##### Registers invalidated after write

Previously, the stale just-written value was presented as a current value.

ROCgdb now invalidates the cached values of registers whose content might differ after being written.
For example, registers with read-only bits.

ROCgdb also invalidates all volatile registers when a volatile register is written.  For example, writing
VCC invalidates the content of STATUS as STATUS.VCCZ may change.

##### Scheduler-locking and GPU wavefronts

When scheduler-locking is in effect, new wavefronts created by a resumed thread, CPU, or GPU
wavefront, are held in the halt state. For example, the "set scheduler-locking" command.

##### ROCDebugger fails before completion of kernel execution

It was possible (although erroneous) for a debugger to load GPU code in memory, send it to the
device, start executing a kernel on the device, and dispose of the original code before the kernel had
finished execution. If a breakpoint was hit after this point, the debugger failed with an internal error
while trying to access the debug information.

This issue is now fixed by ensuring that the debugger keeps a local copy of the original code and
debug information.

### Known issues

#### Random memory access fault errors observed while running math libraries unit tests

**Issue:** Random memory access fault issues are observed while running Math libraries unit tests.
This issue is encountered in ROCm v5.0, ROCm v5.0.1, and ROCm v5.0.2.

Note, the faults only occur in the SRIOV environment.

**Workaround:** Use SDMA to update the page table. The Guest set up steps are as follows:

```sh
sudo modprobe amdgpu vm_update_mode=0
```

To verify, use

**Guest:**

```sh
cat /sys/module/amdgpu/parameters/vm_update_mode 0
```

Where expectation is 0.

#### CU masking causes application to freeze

Using CU Masking results in an application freeze or runs exceptionally slowly. This issue is noticed
only in the GFX10 suite of products. Note, this issue is observed only in GFX10 suite of products.

This issue is under active investigation at this time.

#### Failed checkpoint in Docker containers

A defect with Ubuntu images kernel-5.13-30-generic and kernel-5.13-35-generic with Overlay FS
results in incorrect reporting of the mount ID.

This issue with Ubuntu causes CRIU checkpointing to fail in Docker containers.

As a workaround, use an older version of the kernel. For example, Ubuntu 5.11.0-46-generic.

#### Issue with restoring workloads using cooperative groups feature

Workloads that use the cooperative groups function to ensure all waves can be resident at the same
time may fail to restore correctly. This issue is under investigation and will be fixed in a future release.

#### Radeon Pro V620 and W6800 workstation GPUs

##### No support for ROCDebugger on SRIOV

ROCDebugger is not supported in the SRIOV environment on any GPU.

This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future release.

#### Random error messages in ROCm SMI for SR-IOV

Random error messages are generated by unsupported functions or commands.

This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future release.

## ROCm 5.0.2
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
### Defect fixes

The following defects are fixed in the ROCm v5.0.2 release.

#### Issue with hostcall facility in HIP runtime

In ROCm v5.0, when using the “assert()” call in a HIP kernel, the compiler may sometimes fail to emit
kernel metadata related to the hostcall facility, which results in incomplete initialization of the hostcall
facility in the HIP runtime. This can cause the HIP kernel to crash when it attempts to execute the
“assert()” call.

The root cause was an incorrect check in the compiler to determine whether the hostcall facility is
required by the kernel. This is fixed in the ROCm v5.0.2 release.

The resolution includes a compiler change, which emits the required metadata by default, unless the
compiler can prove that the hostcall facility is not required by the kernel. This ensures that the
“assert()” call never fails.

```note
This fix may lead to breakage in some OpenMP offload use cases, which use print inside a target region
and result in an abort in device code. The issue will be fixed in a future release.
```

The compatibility matrix in the [Deep-learning guide](./how-to/deep-learning-rocm.md) is updated for
ROCm v5.0.2.

## ROCm 5.0.1
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
### Deprecations and warnings

#### Refactor of HIPCC/HIPCONFIG

In prior ROCm releases, by default, the hipcc/hipconfig Perl scripts were used to identify and set target
compiler options, target platform, compiler, and runtime appropriately.

In ROCm v5.0.1, hipcc.bin and hipconfig.bin have been added as the compiled binary implementations
of the hipcc and hipconfig. These new binaries are currently a work-in-progress, considered, and
marked as experimental. ROCm plans to fully transition to hipcc.bin and hipconfig.bin in the a future
ROCm release. The existing hipcc and hipconfig Perl scripts are renamed to `hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl`
respectively. New top-level hipcc and hipconfig Perl scripts are created, which can switch between the
Perl script or the compiled binary based on the environment variable `HIPCC_USE_PERL_SCRIPT`.

In ROCm 5.0.1, by default, this environment variable is set to use hipcc and hipconfig through the Perl
scripts.

Subsequent Perl scripts will no longer be available in ROCm in a future release.

### What's new in this release

#### HIP enhancements

The ROCm v5.0 release consists of the following HIP enhancements.

##### HIP installation guide updates

The HIP Installation Guide is updated to include building HIP from source on the NVIDIA platform.

Refer to the HIP Installation Guide v5.0 for more details.

##### Managed memory allocation

Managed memory, including the `__managed__` keyword, is now supported in the HIP combined host/device compilation. Through unified memory allocation, managed memory allows data to be shared and accessible to both the CPU and GPU using a single pointer. The allocation is managed by the AMD GPU driver using the Linux Heterogeneous Memory Management (HMM) mechanism. The user can call managed memory API hipMallocManaged to allocate a large chunk of HMM memory, execute kernels on a device, and fetch data between the host and device as needed.

> **Note**
>
> In a HIP application,  it is recommended to do a capability check before calling the managed memory APIs. For example,
>
> ```cpp
> int managed_memory = 0;
> HIPCHECK(hipDeviceGetAttribute(&managed_memory,
>   hipDeviceAttributeManagedMemory,p_gpuDevice));
> if (!managed_memory ) {
>   printf ("info: managed memory access not supported on the device %d\n Skipped\n", p_gpuDevice);
> }
> else {
>   HIPCHECK(hipSetDevice(p_gpuDevice));
>   HIPCHECK(hipMallocManaged(&Hmm, N * sizeof(T)));
> . . .
> }
> ```

> **Note**
>
> The managed memory capability check may not be necessary; however, if HMM is not supported, managed malloc will fall back to using system memory. Other managed memory API calls will, then, have

#### New environment variable

The following new environment variable is added in this release:

| Environment Variable | Value                 | Description |
|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT    | 0 or 1 (default is 0) | Some processors support more CUs than can reliably be used in a cooperative dispatch. Setting the environment variable HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT to 1 will cause ROCr to return the correct CU count for cooperative groups through the HSA_AMD_AGENT_INFO_COOPERATIVE_COMPUTE_UNIT_COUNT attribute of hsa_agent_get_info(). Setting HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT to other values, or leaving it unset, will cause ROCr to return the same CU count for the attributes HSA_AMD_AGENT_INFO_COOPERATIVE_COMPUTE_UNIT_COUNT and HSA_AMD_AGENT_INFO_COMPUTE_UNIT_COUNT. Future ROCm releases will make HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT=1 the default. |

### Breaking changes

#### Runtime breaking change

Re-ordering of the enumerated type in hip_runtime_api.h to better match NV.  See below for the difference in enumerated types.

ROCm software will be affected if any of the defined enums listed below are used in the code.  Applications built with ROCm v5.0 enumerated types will work with a ROCm 4.5.2 driver. However, an undefined behavior error will occur with a ROCm v4.5.2 application that uses these enumerated types with a ROCm 5.0 runtime.

ROM Controller specifically when the driver is present. This is because the driver, as part of its runtime
power management feature, puts the dGPU to a sleep state.

As a workaround, users can run amdgpu.runpm=0, which temporarily disables the runtime power
management feature from the driver and dynamically changes some power control-related sysfs files.

#### Issue with START timestamp in ROCProfiler

Users may encounter an issue with the enabled timestamp functionality for monitoring one or multiple
counters. ROCProfiler outputs the following four timestamps for each kernel:

* Dispatch
* Start
* End
* Complete

##### Issue

This defect is related to the Start timestamp functionality, which incorrectly shows an earlier time than
the Dispatch timestamp.

To reproduce the issue,

1. Enable timing using the --timestamp on flag.

2. Use the -i option with the input filename that contains the name of the counter(s) to monitor.

3. Run the program.

4. Check the output result file.

##### Current behavior

BeginNS is lower than DispatchNS, which is incorrect.

##### Expected behavior

The correct order is:

Dispatch < Start < End < Complete

Users cannot use ROCProfiler to measure the time spent on each kernel because of the incorrect
timestamp with counter collection enabled.

##### Recommended workaround

Users are recommended to collect kernel execution timestamps without monitoring counters, as
follows:

1. ​Enable timing using the --timestamp on flag, and run the application.

2. Rerun the application using the -i option with the input filename that contains the name of the
  counter(s) to monitor, and save this to a different output file using the -o flag.

3. Check the output result file from step 1.

4. The order of timestamps correctly displays as: DispatchNS < BeginNS < EndNS < CompleteNS

5. Users can find the values of the collected counters in the output file generated in step 2.

#### Radeon Pro V620 and W6800 workstation GPUs

##### No support for SMI and ROCDebugger on SRIOV

System Management Interface (SMI) and ROCDebugger are not supported in the SRIOV environment
on any GPU. For more information, refer to the Systems Management Interface documentation.

### Deprecations and warnings

#### ROCm libraries changes – deprecations and deprecation removal

* The `hipFFT.h` header is now provided only by the hipFFT package. Up to ROCm 5.0, users would get
  `hipFFT.h` in the rocFFT package too.

* The GlobalPairwiseAMG class is now entirely removed, users should use the PairwiseAMG class
  instead.

* The rocsparse_spmm signature in 5.0 was changed to match that of rocsparse_spmm_ex.  In 5.0,
  rocsparse_spmm_ex is still present, but deprecated. Signature diff for rocsparse_spmm

#### HIP API deprecations and warnings

##### Warning - arithmetic operators of HIP complex and vector types

In this release, arithmetic operators of HIP complex and vector types are deprecated.

* As alternatives to arithmetic operators of HIP complex types, users can use arithmetic operators of
  `std::complex` types.

* As alternatives to arithmetic operators of HIP vector types, users can use the operators of the native
  clang vector type associated with the data member of HIP vector types.

During the deprecation, two macros `_HIP_ENABLE_COMPLEX_OPERATORS` and
`_HIP_ENABLE_VECTOR_OPERATORS` are provided to allow users to conditionally enable arithmetic
operators of HIP complex or vector types.

Note, the two macros are mutually exclusive and, by default, set to Off.

The arithmetic operators of HIP complex and vector types will be removed in a future release.

Refer to the HIP API Guide for more information.

#### Warning - compiler-generated code object version 4 deprecation

Support for loading compiler-generated code object version 4 will be deprecated in a future release
with no release announcement and replaced with code object 5 as the default version.

The current default is code object version 4.

#### Warning - MIOpenTensile deprecation

MIOpenTensile will be deprecated in a future release.

- The block sizes for device merge sorts initial block sort and its merge steps are now separate in its kernel config
    - the block sort step supports multiple items per thread

##### Changed

- size_limit for scan, reduce and transform can now be set in the config struct instead of a parameter
- Device_scan and device_segmented_scan: `inclusive_scan` now uses the input-type as accumulator-type, `exclusive_scan` uses initial-value-type.
  - This particularly changes behaviour of small-size input types with large-size output types (e.g. `short` input, `int` output).
  - And low-res input with high-res output (e.g. `float` input, `double` output)
- Revert old Fiji workaround, because they solved the issue at compiler side
